inspirationStory: "This story was born from our family's deep love for Christmas and the traditions that have been passed down through generations. Growing up, we watched classic holiday films together, decorated the tree while sharing stories, and marveled at nutcracker figurines that seemed to come alive in the twinkling lights. Those moments of pure holiday magic stayed with us, and we wanted to create a story that could capture that same sense of wonder for a new generation.\n\nAs siblings who write together, we've always been fascinated by the idea of ordinary people discovering extraordinary worlds. The concept of a young person stepping into a magical Christmas realm allowed us to explore themes of family, courage, and the enduring power of belief. We drew inspiration from classic holiday tales while adding our own unique spin—a battle not just for a kingdom, but for the very essence of what makes Christmas special.\n\nWriting this book together was its own kind of magic. Late-night brainstorming sessions over hot chocolate, debating the perfect way to describe a nutcracker's march, and laughing over our characters' adventures brought us closer as siblings and as storytellers. We hope that 'The Battle for Christmas' brings the same warmth and joy to your family that creating it brought to ours."
