inspirationStory: "Growing up near the Ohio River, we were surrounded by local legends and stories passed down through generations. Browns Island was real—a mysterious, abandoned stretch of land that captured our imaginations as kids. We'd hear tales from older kids about strange lights, unexplained sounds, and the eerie feeling that someone was watching from the trees. These stories became the stuff of summer campfire tales, dares, and adolescent bravado.\n\nWe always wondered: what would really happen if someone spent a night there? That question became the seed for this story. We wanted to capture the unique tension of being a teenager—that age where you're trying to prove yourself while simultaneously dealing with family drama, personal identity, and the desire for independence. Tommy became the perfect vehicle to explore these themes while delivering an adventure that would have thrilled us as teenagers.\n\nWriting this novelette together allowed us to blend our different perspectives and memories of growing up in a small town where everyone knows everyone, and local legends are as much a part of the landscape as the river itself. We poured our love for atmospheric storytelling and our fascination with the unexplained into every page, creating a story that honors the legends we grew up with while adding our own thrilling twist."
