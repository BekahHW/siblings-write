title: "Escape from Browns Island"
description: "Every small town has legends—but not every kid gets the chance to rewrite them. This novelette starts off with a simple dare: 17-year-old Tommy must spend one summer night alone on Browns Island, an abandoned, 4-mile-long island in the heart of the Ohio River. What he wants is a peaceful night to himself. What he needs is an escape from the chaos he just caused his family. What he finds is an island that isn't abandoned. It is alive and waiting for his arrival."
