summary: "Welcome to summer vacation! The time for good memories, great beaches, and — invasions?\n\nBeach vacations are supposed to be fun. They're meant to bring the family together. But for 13-year-old Mitch, it's not that easy, not when his father recently passed away. It also doesn't help that the island he's staying at gets invaded by alien octopus, turning the quaint beach town into a war zone.\n\nVenturing through pirate ships, hidden coves, mysterious gateways, and a cave of nightmares, Mitch will quickly learn that he plays a vital role in this invasion. If he wants to save his family and defeat the terrifying source of this calamity, Mitch must put aside his grief and turn into the son his dad always knew he could be.\n\nJoin this wild, fantasy adventure where a boy's world gets turned upside down, leaving him only two options: become the hero or — GAME OVER."
inspirationStory: "Our family from Ohio has been vacationing in the Sandbridge area of Virginia Beach for over ten years. On a random day at the beach, we had a 'what if' conversation that sparked the premise for this book.\n\n'What if the only access to this beach was destroyed? What would we do?'\n\nThis spiraled into more questions and more observations about the area. Over time, it evolved into a vast world of mystery inspired by this beach terrain. Zach's focus was to create a story he'd want to read as a kid — one inspired by summer vacations, monsters, video games, and the mystery books he read growing up."
