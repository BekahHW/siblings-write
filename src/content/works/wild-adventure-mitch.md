summary: "Mitch is looking forward to the perfect summer vacation—sun, sand, and hanging out with friends at the beach. What he's not expecting is an invasion that turns his relaxing getaway into the adventure of a lifetime. When mysterious forces threaten the coastal town, Mitch and his friends must band together, using creativity, courage, and quick thinking to save the day. Packed with humor, heart, and plenty of action, this middle-grade adventure proves that heroes can come in any size and that the best summer memories are the ones you never saw coming."
inspirationStory: "This story emerged from our nostalgia for those epic childhood summers that felt endless and full of possibility. We wanted to create a middle-grade adventure that captured that magical time when you're old enough to have real adventures with your friends but young enough to believe that anything is possible. The beach setting was a natural choice—there's something about the ocean that sparks imagination and makes ordinary days feel extraordinary.\n\nWe were inspired by the classic middle-grade adventure books we devoured as kids, where young protagonists save the day through ingenuity and friendship rather than superhuman powers. Mitch represents every kid who's ever felt ordinary but discovered they're capable of extraordinary things when it matters most. We wanted readers to see themselves in Mitch and his friends, to feel that same rush of excitement and empowerment.\n\nCollaborating on this book reminded us why we love writing for middle-grade readers—their enthusiasm, their ability to fully immerse themselves in a story, and their belief that adventures are waiting around every corner. We hope this story inspires young readers to embrace their own adventures, value their friendships, and remember that heroes aren't born—they're made through the choices we make when faced with the unexpected."
