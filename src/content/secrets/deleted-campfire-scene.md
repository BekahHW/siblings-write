# The Campfire Confession
## Deleted Scene from *The Mysterious Forest*

**Editor's Note:** We cut this scene because it revealed too much too early, but we love how it deepens Elena's character. We hope you enjoy this glimpse into a moment that never made it to the final draft.

The campfire crackled between them, sending sparks dancing into the night sky. Elena watched them rise and disappear among the stars, envying their brief moment of brilliance.

"You're quiet tonight," Marcus said, poking at the embers with a stick. "That's not like you."

Elena smiled but didn't look at him. "Just thinking."

"Dangerous pastime."

"Says the boy who thinks for a living."

Marcus chuckled. "Touché." He was quiet for a moment, then added, "Want to talk about it?"

Did she? Elena picked up a small stone and tossed it from hand to hand. The weight of it was comforting, real. Unlike everything else in this cursed forest.

"Do you ever wonder," she began slowly, "if you're the villain in your own story?"

Marcus's stick paused mid-poke. "That's... unexpectedly deep for midnight forest musings."

"I'm serious."

He set the stick aside and turned to face her fully. "Elena, you're literally trying to save your village. Pretty sure that makes you the hero."

"Am I, though?" The words tumbled out before she could stop them. "What if the forest isn't the problem? What if I am? What if I'm the thing that doesn't belong, and by forcing my way through, I'm making everything worse?"

"That's ridiculous—"

"Is it?" She finally met his eyes. "Every place we've been, things get worse after we arrive. The singing trees went silent. The crystal pool turned black. The guardian owls attacked us. What if we're the poison, Marcus? What if *I'm* the poison?"

The fire popped loudly, making them both jump. When Elena looked down, she realized her hands were shaking.

Marcus was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was gentle. "My grandmother used to say that the forest reflects what's in your heart. If you think you're poison, it shows you poison. If you think you're lost, it shows you an endless maze."

"That's not very comforting."

"I wasn't finished." He leaned forward, his face serious in the firelight. "She also said that the forest can't lie. It can only reveal. So if you see darkness, Elena, maybe it's not because you *are* the darkness. Maybe it's because you're the only one brave enough to look at it."

Elena blinked. Once. Twice. "That's either very wise or complete nonsense."

"Could be both." Marcus grinned. "That's the beauty of grandmother wisdom. You don't have to understand it, you just have to survive it."

Despite herself, Elena laughed. The sound felt strange in the oppressive forest, but good. Real.

"Thank you," she said quietly.

"Anytime." Marcus picked up his stick again and returned to poking the fire. "Though for the record, I think you're definitely the hero. Villains don't worry about being villains. They just villain with confidence."

"Villain with confidence?"

"It's a technical term."

Elena threw the stone at him. He dodged, laughing, and the sound echoed through the trees like a promise.

## Why We Cut This Scene

While we loved the vulnerability this scene showed, we realized it gave away Elena's internal conflict too early in the story. Part of the mystery of *The Mysterious Forest* is not knowing whether Elena can trust herself.

This conversation would have robbed the later chapters of their tension. Sometimes the best scenes are the ones you save for another story...

**Fun fact:** We repurposed Marcus's line about "villaining with confidence" and gave it to a different character in Chapter 12. See if you can spot it!
