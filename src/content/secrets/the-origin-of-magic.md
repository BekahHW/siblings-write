# The Origin of Magic in Our Worlds

Welcome, dear subscriber, to one of our deepest secrets. You've unlocked exclusive knowledge about how magic truly works in the stories we create.

## The Three Sources

Magic in our universe flows from three primordial sources, each with its own personality and price:

### 1. The Whisper Stream

The Whisper Stream is the most common source of magic. It flows through the natural world like an invisible river, strongest at dawn and dusk. Those who tap into it hear faint whispers—the voices of everyone who has ever used magic before them.

**The Price:** The more you use it, the louder the whispers become, until eventually, they drown out your own thoughts. This is why powerful mages in our stories often seem distracted or speak to people who aren't there.

### 2. The Ember Forge

Deep beneath the earth, where the world's heat meets ancient stone, lies the Ember Forge. This source grants immense power, but only to those willing to sacrifice something they hold dear—a memory, a talent, or even a loved one's name.

**The Price:** What you sacrifice is erased from existence, not just forgotten. If you trade a memory of your first love, that person becomes someone you never met.

### 3. The Starlight Covenant

The rarest and most dangerous source. When someone makes a deal with the stars themselves, they gain magic that bends reality. But the stars are not kind, and they always collect their debt in unexpected ways.

**The Price:** Time. Every spell cast through the Covenant steals hours, days, or years from your future. Some users age rapidly. Others simply cease to exist when they run out of borrowed time.

## Why This Matters

In every story we write, magic has rules. We never want magic to feel like a simple solution—it should always come with weight, with consequence. When you read our stories and see a character hesitate before casting a spell, now you know why.

Some characters draw from multiple sources. Some don't even know which source they're using. And in our upcoming novels, you'll meet characters who've discovered a fourth source—one even we haven't fully explored yet.

## A Secret Within a Secret

If you look carefully in our published works, we've hidden clues about which source each character uses. Here's your first clue: characters who use the Whisper Stream often touch their ears when concentrating. Watch for it in *The Mysterious Forest*.
