# Whispers in the Dark
## Chapter One: The Letter

**Author's Note:** This is an early draft of Chapter One from our upcoming novel *Whispers in the Dark*. The final published version will likely be different, but we wanted to share this raw, unpolished glimpse into a story we're crafting for you.

---

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, which should have been Mira's first clue that something was wrong.

Nothing interesting ever happened on Tuesdays. Mondays brought the crushing return to routine. Wednesdays offered the false hope of being halfway through the week. Fridays promised freedom. But Tuesdays? Tuesdays were the forgotten middle child of the week, bland and unremarkable.

Yet here it was: a cream-colored envelope with her name written in emerald ink, sitting on her desk like it had every right to be there.

Mira stared at it through her English class, ignoring Ms. Peterson's passionate defense of semicolons. She stared at it through lunch, while her best friend Chloe talked about the basketball team's latest drama. She was still staring at it when the final bell rang and the other students stampeded toward freedom.

"You know," Chloe said, leaning against Mira's desk, "most people actually *open* their mail."

"It wasn't in my locker," Mira said. "It wasn't in my bag. It was just... here. On my desk. When I got to class."

Chloe shrugged. "So someone put it there. Secret admirer, maybe?"

"Written in emerald ink?"

"Fancy secret admirer?"

Mira finally picked up the envelope. It was heavier than it looked, and the paper had a texture like old parchment. No return address. No stamp. Just her name in that flowing, old-fashioned script:

*Mira Chen*

"Well?" Chloe prompted. "Are you going to open it or should I?"

Before Mira could answer, Chloe snatched the envelope and tore it open with the enthusiasm of someone who'd never heard of patience. A single card fell out, hitting the desk with a sound too loud for paper.

Mira picked it up. The card was the same cream color as the envelope, with words written in that same emerald ink:

---

*Dear Mira Chen,*

*You are cordially invited to attend the Academy of Whispered Arts, where students learn to hear what others cannot, see what remains hidden, and speak with voices that shape reality.*

*Your gift has been noticed.*

*Your presence is requested.*

*Your destiny awaits.*

*Classes begin at midnight on the first new moon. A door will find you.*

*Signed,*
*Headmaster Erasmus Thorne*

Mira read it twice. Then a third time. Then she looked at Chloe, who was grinning like someone had just handed her the keys to a candy store.

"This is the coolest thing that has ever happened to you," Chloe declared.

"This is a prank."

"Obviously. But it's a *really good* prank."

Mira turned the card over. The back was blank. She held it up to the light, looking for watermarks or hidden messages. Nothing.

"Who even knows about secret schools for magical arts these days?" Mira muttered. "This is so overdone. Next thing you know, they'll send an owl."

"I wish someone would send me an owl." Chloe took the card and examined it with the seriousness of a detective. "Okay, but real talk? This paper is expensive. Like, *really* expensive. This isn't your standard prank material."

"So someone rich thinks they're funny."

"Or," Chloe said, her eyes lighting up with that particular gleam that meant she was about to say something ridiculous, "it's real."

Mira laughed. It came out sharper than she intended. "Right. I'm secretly magical, and some mysterious academy wants to teach me to... what, whisper at people? That's my superpower?"

"I've heard you whisper. It's pretty scary."

"Chloe—"

"I'm just saying, weird things happen around you."

"Weird things happen around everyone."

"Yeah, but your weird things are *consistently* weird." Chloe started counting on her fingers. "Last month, you knew my phone was going to ring three seconds before it did. The week before that, you told me to avoid the cafeteria, and then the pipes burst and flooded the whole room. And remember in October when you—"

"That was all coincidence."

"Sixteen coincidences?"

"I've been counting."

Mira opened her mouth to argue, then closed it. Because the truth was, she *had* noticed. The little moments when she knew things she shouldn't know. The flashes of insight that felt like memories of things that hadn't happened yet. The way shadows sometimes moved when she wasn't looking directly at them.

She'd chalked it up to pattern recognition, or intuition, or good old-fashioned luck.

But what if—

No.

"It's a prank," Mira said firmly, shoving the card into her bag. "A really elaborate, really expensive prank. Probably Tyler and his friends trying to mess with me."

Chloe didn't look convinced, but she let it drop. "Fine. But when a mysterious door appears and whisks you away to magic school, I'm demanding visitation rights."

"Deal."

They packed up their things and headed out into the October afternoon. The air smelled like dead leaves and coming rain. Mira pulled her jacket tighter and tried to forget about cream-colored paper and emerald ink.

She almost succeeded.

Until she got home and found her bedroom door had been replaced.

Instead of the plain white door with the chipped paint and the dent from that one time she'd slammed it too hard, there was an ornate wooden door that definitely hadn't been there this morning. It was dark mahogany, carved with intricate patterns that hurt to look at too closely. And set into the center, glowing faintly, was a keyhole in the shape of a crescent moon.

Mira stood in the hallway for a full minute, her backpack sliding forgotten from her shoulder.

A door will find you.

"Okay," she whispered to no one. "Maybe not a prank."

The door, as if in agreement, began to glow.

## Author Notes

This is where Chapter One ends in the current draft. We're still working on Mira's character voice—does she feel too skeptical? Not skeptical enough? Let us know your thoughts when you see this published!

The door imagery came from a dream one of us had. We knew immediately that we wanted to write a story about doors that find you, rather than you finding them.

**Question for you:** Should the door speak, or should it remain mysterious and silent? We're genuinely torn on this, and your intuition might help us decide.
