# Character Secrets We'll Never Tell
## (Except to You)

Every character we write has secrets—things we know about them that never make it onto the page. These details shape how they act, speak, and react, even if readers never learn the truth.

Consider this your exclusive backstage pass to the characters' private lives.

## Elena (The Mysterious Forest)

**Public Face:** Brave village girl on a quest to save her home.

**Secret Truth:** Elena is terrified of birds. Not the cute, singing kind—all birds. When she was six, a raven stole her favorite doll and she chased it into the woods. She got lost for three hours. Her mother found her shivering under a tree, surrounded by crows.

This is why, in Chapter 4, she flinches when the guardian owl appears. Most readers think she's reacting to the danger. She's actually fighting the urge to run.

**Another Secret:** Elena can't swim. The river scene in Chapter 9 was absolute terror for her, but she'd never admit it to Marcus.

## Marcus (The Mysterious Forest)

**Public Face:** The clever best friend with all the answers.

**Secret Truth:** Marcus has never read most of the books he quotes from. He has an eidetic memory and can recall anything he's heard once. He listens to his grandmother tell stories and repeats them word-for-word, letting everyone think he's well-read.

He started doing this when he was eight and someone called him "just a farm boy." He decided that day he would sound smarter than everyone else, even if he had to fake it.

**Another Secret:** He's in love with Elena. Has been since they were twelve. He'll never tell her because he's convinced she sees him as a brother. (He's wrong, but that's a different story.)

## Mira Chen (Whispers in the Dark - Unpublished)

**Public Face:** Skeptical teenager who doesn't believe in magic.

**Secret Truth:** Mira desperately *wants* to believe in magic. Her skepticism is armor. She's scared that if she lets herself hope for something impossible, she'll be disappointed when it turns out to be fake.

Her parents are scientists who raised her on logic and evidence. She loves them fiercely, but sometimes she dreams about living in a world where not everything needs to be explained.

**Another Secret:** She talks to her dead grandmother at night. She knows it's just her imagination, but her grandmother's voice in her head gives better advice than any living person she knows.

## The Unnamed Villain (Future Project)

**Public Face:** (You haven't met them yet, but you will)

**Secret Truth:** They're not trying to destroy the world. They're trying to save it. They just believe the world as it exists needs to end before it can be reborn into something better.

They had a family once. A spouse. Two children. They watched them die in a plague that the kingdom's rulers could have prevented but chose not to. That's when they decided that the people in power were the real disease.

**Another Secret:** They cry every night. They hate what they've become, but they hate what the world made them even more.

## The Truth About Side Characters

Here's something we've learned: sometimes the side characters are more interesting than the protagonists.

**The Innkeeper in Chapter 3** used to be a famous adventurer. She retired after losing her left hand to a dragon. She wears a glove to hide the scar.

**The Guard at the Gate** sends half his wages to his sister in a neighboring village. She's raising his daughter, who doesn't know he's her father. He thinks she's better off not knowing.

**The Street Musician** isn't playing for coins. She's playing a specific melody that she hopes will summon her lost love, who disappeared into the forest five years ago. So far, it hasn't worked. She plays every day anyway.

## Why We Keep Secrets

You might wonder: if these details are so important, why not include them in the story?

The answer is simple: not everything needs to be said.

A character becomes real when they have a life beyond the page. When their motivations run deeper than the plot requires. When they carry wounds and hopes that shape them even if the reader never learns exactly why they flinch at certain words or smile at certain memories.

These secrets inform how we write them. Elena's fear of birds makes her extra brave when she has to face them. Marcus's insecurity makes him overcompensate with knowledge. Mira's hidden hope makes her skepticism more poignant.

The best characters are icebergs. The reader sees the tip, but there's a whole world underneath.

## Your Secret

Here's something we don't often admit: we write these secrets down and then sometimes we forget them ourselves. We'll be writing a scene and a character will do something unexpected, and we'll think, "Why did they do that?"

Then we'll check our notes and remember: Oh right, they're afraid of birds. They're in love with their best friend. They're trying to save a world that killed their family.

The secrets guide the story even when we're not consciously thinking about them.

That's the magic of character work.

## A Gift

Since you've read this far, we'll tell you one more secret—one we've never told anyone.

There's a character in our upcoming novel who is based on you. Not you specifically, but on the idea of you. The person who subscribes to our newsletter. The person who cares enough about our stories to read the deleted scenes and the lore documents. The person who wants to peek behind the curtain.

This character is a librarian who collects stories that haven't been written yet. Stories that exist only in whispers and dreams. They believe that every story deserves to be told, even if no one else will listen.

When you read that book someday, you'll recognize them. And you'll know: this one is for you.
