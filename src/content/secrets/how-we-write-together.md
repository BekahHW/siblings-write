# How We Actually Write Together
## Behind the Scenes of Siblings Write

People often ask us: "How do you write together? Do you take turns? Do you split up chapters? Do you ever fight?"

Short answers: We don't know, not really, and *oh yes*.

## The Real Process

Here's what a typical writing session looks like for us:

### Hour 1: The Optimism Phase

We sit down with coffee (or tea, depending on who won the argument about whose turn it is to make drinks). We open the document. We read what we wrote last time. We say things like:

- "This is actually pretty good!"
- "I think we're really onto something here."
- "This should be easy to continue."

This phase rarely lasts longer than twenty minutes.

### Hour 2: The Divergence

One of us types a sentence. The other one immediately deletes it. Not because it's bad—although sometimes it is—but because it's not quite *right*. We've learned that "not quite right" is the most common phrase in our writing sessions.

This is where the magic happens, though. We start talking through the scene:

**Author 1:** "What if she doesn't go into the forest yet?"
**Author 2:** "But she has to, that's the whole plot."
**Author 1:** "Yeah, but what if she hesitates?"
**Author 2:** "Ooh, what if someone pushes her? Literally?"
**Author 1:** "Or what if the forest comes to her?"

And suddenly we're writing something neither of us planned.

### Hour 3: The Argument

We disagree. Usually about something small that feels monumental:

- Should this character use a semicolon or a dash in their dialogue? (Yes, we argue about punctuation in speech)
- Would someone really say "perhaps" or would they say "maybe"?
- Is this scene too dark, or not dark enough?

The beautiful thing about writing with a sibling is that you can have a passionate argument about the emotional weight of a comma, and fifteen minutes later you're making lunch together like nothing happened.

### Hour 4-6: The Flow State

If we make it past the argument, something magical happens. We stop thinking about who's typing. The story takes over. One of us writes a line, the other builds on it. Back and forth like a conversation, except we're both pretending to be fictional people in fictional situations.

Sometimes we forget who wrote what. We'll come back days later and one of us will say, "I love this line!" and the other will say, "I thought you wrote that?" and we both shrug because it doesn't matter anymore.

It's *our* story.

### Hour 7: The Crash

We look at the clock. We're hungry. The coffee is cold. We've written three pages or fifteen pages or sometimes we've rewritten the same paragraph seventeen times until it finally feels right.

We save the document. We close our laptops. We promise we'll write again tomorrow.

Sometimes we do. Sometimes we don't. Sometimes life gets in the way. Sometimes the story isn't ready and we need to let it simmer.

## The Secret Ingredient

The real secret to our collaborative process? **Trust**.

We trust each other to:
- Delete our favorite sentences if they don't serve the story
- Add things we didn't plan
- Challenge our ideas
- Make the work better than either of us could alone

We also trust each other to know when to step back. If one of us is exhausted, the other carries the weight. If one of us is stuck, the other finds the path forward.

Writing together means sharing the victories and the doubts, the brilliant days and the days where every word feels like pulling teeth.

## The Truth About Collaboration

Here's what we've learned after years of writing together:

1. **You will disagree.** That's good. If you always agree, one of you isn't necessary.

2. **Kill your darlings, together.** It hurts less when someone else agrees it needs to go.

3. **Celebrate the small wins.** Finishing a scene is worth celebrating. Nailing a piece of dialogue is worth celebrating. Writing *anything* on a hard day is worth celebrating.

4. **Your process will be unique.** What works for us might not work for other writing teams, and that's okay.

5. **The work is bigger than both of you.** The story doesn't belong to one person. It belongs to the world you create together.

## A Typical Exchange

Just for fun, here's a real snippet from our writing chat:

**Author 1:** "I think Marcus should fall in the river."
**Author 2:** "Why?"
**Author 1:** "Because it would be funny."
**Author 2:** "We're writing a serious fantasy novel."
**Author 1:** "A serious fantasy novel where Marcus falls in a river."
**Author 2:** "..."
**Author 2:** "Okay but what if Elena pushes him?"
**Author 1:** "PERFECT"

(Marcus ended up falling in the river in Chapter 8. Sorry, Marcus.)

## Thank You

To everyone who reads our work: thank you for caring about the stories we create together. We hope this peek behind the curtain shows you that the messy, chaotic, argument-filled process is all part of the magic.

And yes, we're probably arguing about something right now.
