**The Haunted Harvest**

**by: Zach**

The full moon illuminated the overgrown pumpkin patch below. This pumpkin patch was unlike any other one. It wasn’t planted by a farmer and rarely produced healthy pumpkins. From where it came from, no one knew. Years earlier, it overtook old man Sapp’s orchard. He tried every farmer’s trick in the book, but he couldn’t get rid of it. Eventually, the vines strangled all of his apple trees, leaving him no other choice but to abandon the land.

“Are you sure she’s in there, Sheriff?” asked Floyd, a tall middle-aged man standing amongst a small group of adults.

“Yes,” stammered the Sheriff. “I wouldn’t have called you guys if I didn’t need help.”

“Am I missing something?” asked another man. “Why don’t you just walk in and find her?”

“Well, um. It’s Halloween night, and I just…” the sheriff trailed off. “I can’t do it without you.”

“Oh, sure. Whatever you say, Sheriff.” The man turned on his flashlight. “Let’s go, everyone, so we can find the sheriff’s wife.” As he said “wife,” he made the quotation marks’ motion with his hands.

The group, equipped with flashlights, headed into the entangled pumpkin-patch-orchard. Spoiled pumpkins dangled from the thick vines wrapped around the apple trees. The people were so eager to enter that none of them noticed how little light their flashlights produced against the darkness in front of them. If not for the moon, they’d all be walking in blind.

A deputy who stayed back patted the sheriff on the back, then pointed to a propane torch leaning against the wheel of the sheriff's patrol car.

“Nice blowtorch you've got there." Before the sheriff could respond, the deputy continued, "I don’t know what you’re up to, but you’re really selling it this time. If it wasn’t for your pranks last Halloween, I might actually believe you!” The deputy started to walk into the orchard but stopped when the sheriff grabbed him.

“Be ready for anything,” said the sheriff as he handed him a long hunting knife. The deputy shook his head, smiling. Then, he turned and walked into the orchard.

The sheriff stood frozen, staring blankly into the orchard. After a long moment, he walked away in the opposite direction.

“Oh my goodness. Over here. Over here!” a middle-aged woman screamed. “It’s…it’s...a pumpkin!”

Everyone screamed, mocking the situation.

“We are doomed! This is undoubtedly a haunted orchard brought to life by the full, Halloween moon.”

“I love you, Mom. I’m sorry I was such a bad kid.”

Everyone laughed harder as they trekked deeper into the orchard.

“What are the odds the Sheriff’s wife is even in here?”

“Now that I think of it, I think I saw her walking their dog around here earlier today.”

“Aha! The sheriff never mentioned the dog missing. What a bad prankster.”

The line of people continued forward until—

“Alright, everyone. We hit a wall. Time to re-direct.”

The group turned—except for one person who tried pushing past the “dead end.”

“What are you talking about? That’s not a dead end.”

Everyone turned to see a clear path to where they had just come from. Through the decrepit apple trees, they saw a purple fire a short distance away in the middle of the orchard. The leader of the pack climbed forward through the thick, knotted trees, towards the fire until he reached a clearing.

“Gotta say, Sheriff, this one’s turning out to be better than I thought!”

One by one, they climbed through the thicket of trees until all of them were in the heart of he orchard. Waiting in front of them wasn’t the sheriff’s wife, but something even more surprising—

A wide open section with a picnic table in the middle with pizza, chips, and beer. A large “Happy Halloween” banner stretched across the branches of a tree. Tiki torches with hypnotizing purple flames illuminated the area.

“As lame as this prank was, at least we get pizza!”

“But…what if it’s poisoned pizza!”

“I’ll take that risk!”

They dove into the pizza and beer, howling like wolves in between bites.

One of them examined the torch. “I don’t know how he made it purple, but I’ll give it to him, that’s pretty cool.”

***

On the hill above the orchard, the sheriff looked out below, where he could see everyone in between the torches. His eyes were bloodshot. His tears glistened in the moonlight.

He turned to face a towering tree. Its branches were thin and frail like a spider, stretching outward in all directions. Vines coiled around the trunk of the tree. And under the vines, a face. A woman’s face. The sheriff’s wife, wrapped around the trunk. A dog collar on the ground below her.

“I’ve done as you’ve asked,” said the sheriff as he faced the tree. “Now let her go.”

He waited, gasping in small breaths. The vines began to glow with purple flames. A whirlwind of air pushed down upon the orchard, sending the vines into a wave of reverberations.

From deep within the earth, a frail voice exhaled one word, “Goooooooooooo.”

His wife fell from the tree, free from the vines. The sheriff clasped her arm and ran off with her.

***

Floyd stood next to a tiki torch, entranced by its purple light, eating pizza.

“Man. I could get used to his pranks. Speaking of the sheriff, where is he?” He turned towards the picnic table. Everyone was gone. “Hey. Where’d everyone go?”

His pizza fell to the ground as vines wrapped around his legs, pulling him deep, deep into the darkest part of the orchard, where even the moon couldn't find.
