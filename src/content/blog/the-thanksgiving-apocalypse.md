**The Thanksgiving Apocalypse**

**by: Joshua Hawrot**

"I'm thankful that the world didn't just come to an end."

Serena frantically ran down 5th Street in chaos as the end of the world collapsed all around. Nearly tripping over someone on the road, she barely was able to jump over them when she noticed it took her a little longer to reach the ground.

Around her, the air and weather fluctuated like someone had them on a roulette—hot, cold, sunny, storms. Looking up, she saw the sun fly across the sky making everything as dark as night. Thirty seconds later, it returned with a sunrise on the opposite horizon—stars to blue sky to stars again.

Serena bolted towards her house but found her foot not being able to touch the ground. Seconds later, she was floating into the air. Loose objects and people around followed suit.

*This is it!* Serena thought and closed her eyes tightly.

And then it ended.

Serena fell back towards the ground and landed with a soft thud. She quickly rolled away as a variety of other objects and people rained down on and around her.

The sun was back at three in the afternoon. The air was very windy but warm, and the world seemed to be settling.

Crawling, standing, then stumbling, Serena managed making it to her house a block away. She opened the door and then passed out.

Minutes—or hours later—Serena awoke to the sound of cries and sirens out on the street. Holding her aching head, she stepped out of her door to see what the broken world looked like.

People scurried across the streets, many headed towards downtown. Some smoke filled the air as a group attempted to put out a small fire. Many seemed to walk aimlessly, still shocked at what had happened.

Further down 5th Street, Serena saw a couple of figures bust through a window of a nearby grocery store. Fear welled up in her gut.

*It's going to get even uglier here before long, *she thought.* I better get back inside.*

Right as she was turning around, something ran into her leg, and she cried, "OUCH!"

Looking down, she saw a young kid, maybe four. He didn't see her and ran right into her leg.

"I'm so sorry! Fred! Over here!" called a man who must have been his dad. He was walking down the sidewalk towards her and was accompanied by his wife, holding a baby. The woman was crying incessantly.

"I'm fine, it's fine," said Serena as she rubbed her leg. "Is she okay?" she asked, looking towards the woman.

The man glanced towards her and replied, "Yes, yes, we are ok. Thankfully."

He then slowed them down to a halt and looked out over the streets.

"Not sure if you've heard anything, but they said it's alright now," he said.

"Alright?" Serena questioned.

"Yes—that we're back on course somehow. No one knows how. They said almost like something knocked us back on course. There's a million questions but right now it looks like we are alright!"

Serena made little sense of his words.

The man's wife wiped her eyes and spoke up, "And yes, yes, I am okay. Thanks for asking. I'm just shocked and thankful. We are thankful we were spared! These are mostly tears of joy!"

The man looked ahead to his running son. "We are down the street on 4th if you need anything. God bless!" he called out as he trotted down the street towards his son.

Serena looked on in wonder as she watched the family continue walking towards a nearby church and then go in.

*Thankful?* she thought. *Thankful. We are still here. Something happened.*

Serena looked around at the neighborhood. It was a mess. Both the street and the people looked wrecked. In it, though, she felt a little less fear and more camaraderie.

*We all made it through together,* she thought with a big sigh. It was the same feeling after a town started recovering after a huge blizzard or storm, except much, much bigger.

At that moment, an idea sparked in her mind.

She ran to the garage and started carrying out two long tables and the only five chairs she had. Dragging them to the street, she set them up right in the middle lane line and added the chairs.

For the next half an hour, Serena scrounged through her kitchen and cupboards and started to bring out whatever food she could find. She started frying up bacon, made some lunchmeat sandwiches, tossed a quick salad, and brought out two bottles of lemonade.

An impromptu street dinner was born. After an hour, more food was filled onto the table.

"Hey, Serena!" called out her neighbor, Roger, as he picked up his garbage can. "What's this about?"

"Do you have any tables and chairs?" she quickly replied. "Also, is that grill of yours working?"

Roger gave her a puzzled look. He saw a spark in her eyes, and without another word, the lightbulb went off with him as well.

"You bet the grill works. Let me fire it up. Then I'll bring out the tables."

A chain reaction started. More people on 5th Street noticed the commotion. Tables were springing up on the road, and food started traveling from each house. A new energy was being felt, and it became contagious.

Soon, 4th and 3rd Street caught wind of what was going on, and more card tables, coffee tables, and even some dining room tables were being brought out to make one enormously long chain table in the road.

And so the tables grew, down 4th Street past St. Pete’s and Big Red, past Bookmarx and Leonardos, and all the way towards Steve's and even the library! Not only that, but the wave of grace went uptown as well. Up Market and Washington, throughout LaBelle and Pleasant Heights, across the neighborhoods of Sunset and past Central to M&M, Dicarlo's, and into Wintersville, the streets came alive as tables, chairs, and food were ushered out.

More and more people started to help. Over the next three hours, grills were grilling, ovens were baking (where there were generators), decorations were brought out, kids played with the kids across the street, even the animals and pets seemed to be at ease. The fear, the tension, the confusion and shock were slowly being replaced with generosity, charity, fun, and even laughter.

In that moment of time, every dividing line in the city seemed to dissolve and suture. They were simply: Thankful Steubenville.

Finally, the food was on tables in almost every street and alley in Steubenville. It was a variety never before seen from cereal to Gyros to pasta to sushi to enchiladas to juice boxes. And never had it looked so good! All the people then gathered at the longest string of tables in human history and sat down.

Back on 5th Street, Serena remained standing with a glass of lemonade raised in her hands. She looked across at all her neighbors and friends and tears welled in her eyes. Looking up to Heaven, she raised her glass even higher and said, "Thank you."

And then the feasting began.
