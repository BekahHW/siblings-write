    content: "The climactic battle went through major revisions to add emotional depth:"
    before: "The nutcrackers fought the shadow creatures. Tim helped them win."
    after: "As shadows engulfed the palace, Tim realized the battle wasn't just about swords and soldiers—it was about keeping hope alive. Each toy soldier who stood firm was powered by a child's belief in Christmas magic."

    title: "The Hardest Part to Write"

    title: "Why Tim Had to Be Ordinary"
    content: "We didn't give Tim special powers or a chosen-one destiny. He's just a kid who cares. Because that's enough. Caring is its own kind of magic."

    title: "The Message We Hope You Take Away"
    content: "Christmas magic isn't just about believing in Santa or magic. It's about believing in hope, in family, in the idea that light can shine even in the darkest times. That's the real magic."
