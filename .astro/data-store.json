All it took was a few inches of snow, and the hill would be flooded with kids, just like you’d see in the movies. Rows of sledders waited at the top of the hill for someone to yell out, “GO!” so they could race to the frozen creek at the bottom.\n\nIt was pure small-town livin’. Kids having fun. Parents happy cuz their kids were happy. Sounds good, right? Wrong.\n\nEverything ended abruptly, and this marked the beginning of the psyop.\n\n\u003Ch3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Phase one psyop\u003C/h3>\n\nThe killjoys, the hall monitors, the fun police, the fossils, the grown-ups—whatever you want to call them—told all the kids they weren’t allowed to sled there anymore.

Where exactly would they fill this void? You guessed it—at Stanley’s mall.\n\nAs the kids would say, the mall was now “bumpin'.” Parents were forced to allocate part of their Powerball investment so that their kids had money to spend at Stanley’s mall.

Who orchestrated this master plan starting with Jeff Tech, predicting the human course of behavior all the way to parents’ having no choice but to grow closer to their kids?\n\nNo one other than a psyop brought to you by your local community center promoting their new campaign, “The Year of the Family.” Their manager —David Opal Sr.—socially engineered every level of it, all so he could be promoted to president. He first planted the seed to Stanley, predicting what would likely happen next. He single-handedly ruined sled riding in the valley all for the sake of a job title.

It's across a field at the base of a hill, Pleasant Heights. This is a large neighborhood that stretches back to the hospital and then dips back down into Beatty Park below. There's not much to notice about this little landmark. It appears as a collapsed entrance to an old mine. Locals report it used to be a watering station for horses heading that direction a long time ago. And they are correct. But that is only part of it. There are rumors that there is more to it. That it is an abandoned bunker or science lab from the previous century. That it is a burial ground for Native Americans or that a mythical beast sleeps beneath. Or, a Civil War general hid his gold there when escaping west from the war. Whatever the case, it's always intrigued me as a kid, and I've fated myself with one day exploring what it actually is. And today is that day! A special thanks goes out to the Ohio Valley Historical Society as well as the Pittsburgh Archeological Foundation, who both sponsored this event. In moments, we will see what lies beneath the hill of Pleasant Heights, and hopefully, it is as pleasant as its name!\"\n\nSome light chuckles emitted from the nearly dozen people who stood on the grass observing the event.\n\n\"I, Martin Smythe, and my cameraman, Denson, will be recording each step along the way. You'll all be able to see it on this screen or posted live online for those not with us.\"\n\nThe explorer waved at the camera to those watching from the internet.\n\n\"Now let the show begin!\"\n\nThe camera kept on the explorer, and they approached the collapsed entrance to the tunnel. As rocks and dirt were dug out, the camera shook as the two men climbed around and into the darkness on the other side. The beams of their flashlights led the way.\n\n\"The air is musty and damp. There appears to be a path leading down into the cave. No litter or garbage. Seems like no one has been here in a long time.\"\n\nFurther down into the dark cave, the two men went. Their flashlights wandered up and down the walls, looking for anything interesting or out of place.\n\n\"And as we examine these rocks, we can....oh wait...what's this?\"\n\nMartin directed the camera to the ground towards what looked like a concrete floor. Following it around, they saw it connected to walls and a low ceiling as well. It was as if the cave led into an underground building.\n\n\"It looks like there might be something to the bunker theory!\" Martin exclaimed to the camera.\n\nFurther in they went as Martin described the now man-made walls of the tunnel sloping down. They came across various rooms along the hallway. Some were empty, while others were filled with old office furniture. Several had what looked like primitive machines from the 50s or 60s that somehow still had power. Blips and beeps disrupted the otherwise silent building.\n\n\"We could easily spend a whole week looking at all of this! This is amazing! It appears the tunnel keeps going, though, and we will press on!\"\n\nFurther down, the concrete walls soon turned to rock again. The air was colder and even more damp.\n\n\"By my calculations, we may be approaching deep beneath downtown Steubenville. The river would be beyond,\" said Martin to the camera.\n\nAs he said this, he noticed his voice echoed across the walls as if entering a larger open space. A faint glow appeared around the bend. Picking up the pace, they cleared the corner and were speechless at what they saw.\n\nThe camera fluttered this way and that, taking in the scene in front of them. They were in a giant cavern. The ceiling rose 100 yards. Beneath it looked like an abandoned little city, with buildings lining the streets. Some structures looked more modern, while others had older architecture. A few entire buildings stood out and were of a design Martin had never seen before. The cave seemed to stretch back a quarter mile. Oddly enough, the back wall appeared luminescent, like glowing rock.\n\nMartin stepped forward into the room and felt like he was walking through a thin, invisible waterfall. Immediately, the back wall pulsed, and a wave of wind and light traveled across the room. The two men fell to the ground, and the camera slid away.\n\nWhat happened next is not fully describable. As the camera continued rolling, flashes of images appeared with each wave of light from the wall.\n\nPulse. Darkness and fear. Giant shapes moved in the cave. Pulse. Two people brought a light that grew across the back wall, and the dark shapes left. Pulse. People appeared, and soon buildings, streets, and a thriving city. Pulse. The people were gone, and the buildings deteriorated. Different people showed up, and the light dimmed. Pulse. These new people also left, the light dimmed further, and the dark shapes appeared on the other side of the wall. Pulse. The light faded as the dark creatures broke into the cavern. Fear returned.\n\nThese images then cycled back to the beginning and started over, this time picking up speed and intensity.\n\nThe explorers looked on with tears in their eyes. The magnificence, mystery, and terror at what they saw was overwhelming.\n\nWithout warning, the wind and light picked back up even more. The camera fell to the ground and slid backward as the wind drove it further into the tunnel.\n\nThe last shot the camera saw was the two explorers holding onto a rock. Martin yelled something inaudible to Denson as the roaring wind nearly took them off their feet.\n\nThere was another flash of light, and then the camera went black.\n\nThat was the last of the recording.\n\nThere was a moment of uneasiness in the room as the screen went blank. Finally, a voice spoke up.\n\n\"What was the date on the recording?\" said a man with a deep voice.\n\n\"May 10, 2025,\" a second person responded, sounding slightly flustered. \"That is almost twenty-two years from now.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"And who found this?\"\n\n\"A couple kids at Beatty Park found a little cave. They discovered the camera and brought it to their parents. Eventually, it found its way to us.\"\n\n\"And the explorer, do we have an identification on him?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we found a match. A local living on La Belle. Except....\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"He's only seven.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"Hmm, why didn't we stop him?\" the man pondered to himself. \"Something must have happened. Obviously we were...unless...\" The unfinished thought hung heavy in the air. He regained his posture and continued, \"Very well then. Business as usual. Keep an eye on the boy and keep people away from the cave. Also, we'll have to pick things up. Give me more regular reports on the mill. I have a feeling that's going to escalate before we know it. Apparently, we may only have twenty-two years. Let's pray it gives us enough time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. We will keep you posted.\"\n\nThe man turned to leave the room.\n\n\"Oh, one more thing, Denson....we'll have to work on your camera skills.

The people were gone, and the buildings deteriorated. Different people showed up, and the light dimmed. Pulse. These new people also left, the light dimmed further, and the dark shapes appeared on the other side of the wall. Pulse. The light faded as the dark creatures broke into the cavern. Fear returned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These images then cycled back to the beginning and started over, this time picking up speed and intensity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The explorers looked on with tears in their eyes. The magnificence, mystery, and terror at what they saw was overwhelming.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Without warning, the wind and light picked back up even more.

Keep an eye on the boy and keep people away from the cave. Also, we’ll have to pick things up. Give me more regular reports on the mill. I have a feeling that’s going to escalate before we know it.

Complete with \"Over 100 toppings!\" You never had to have the same twice. He picked vanilla in a bowl. That is Dale, and twenty years later, the vanilla streak continued to go strong.\n\nCharismatic and lively he was not. Predictable and a man of habit he was. Dale's life was so calculated, that you could predict what he would be doing this time and day in 2040. It was a small world, but he knew it inside and out.\n\nOf all his orchestrations, his \"most adventurous\" habit was his run.\n\nDale would be up at 5 a.m., have two quick cups of coffee and a Cliff bar by 5:15, have clothes and briefcase laid out for the day by 5:20, and out the door at 5:30 to start his light jog. His circuit included winding in and around Brady Estates, towards Krogers grocery store, around the back to a side entrance of Union Cemetery Hill, and finally circling down Sunset Blvd back to home. He'd arrive back at his front door at 6:15 for his third cup of coffee.\n\n​\nHe didn't push himself too hard- not hard enough to break a sweat. Jogging helped him stay in decent enough shape. It was the controlled routine he mostly appreciated. Also the quiet.\n\nThe town was still waking up at 5:30 and he had the road to himself with only three exceptions.\n\nThere was the pitbull he nicknamed Baskerville. He lived at old man Henry's house near Krogers right along the route. Henry had a reputation for his crazy conspiracies and seemed a little off to many people. His dog adopted some of the craziness as well. Baskerville waited for Dale every morning to tighten his chain and wake up the neighborhood.\n\nThen there was Jim, the security guard at Krogers who was usually arriving late while Dale jogged by. A quick wave and a, \"Hey, what’s up?” was the extent of their relationship.\n\nAnd then there was he, the mysterious girl.\n\nIn fact, she wasn't too mysterious, but she remained a mystery to Dale. Every day, she would be out there jogging the same circuit, but about 100 yards ahead of him. She was faster though, and by the time Dale would be hitting his homestretch, she was long gone.\n\nFor months he never saw her face but she kept her pace and distance like clockwork. He sometimes imagined what she looked like, where she worked if he'd seen her before in passing.\n\nFor a few days, she didn't run. On those days Dale would miss her- his \"orange scrunchie anonymous jogging partner\". He ran slightly slower those days.\n\nDale's fascination kept growing though. One time he even imagined trying to catch up to her, but quickly thought better of it. It would break his routine number one. Secondly, she was too fast. Thirdly she might be freaked out. And fourthly, what if through all that he built up in his mind, he ends up disappointed? She's better left to his imagination.\n\nAnd so the weeks continued and into months. Dale continued his morning jog as dutifully and comfortably as ever.\n\nThen everything changed the day Dale's normal routine went haywire; crazy as Old Henry.\n\n**Part 2: Destiny This Way**\n\nEvery Saturday Dale would predictably walk a mile from his house to a meatball shop. It was his favorite part of the week. Across the street was a hill with trees and at the top a neighborhood. The odd thing about his hill was a concrete stairwell that went halfway up the hill but stopped. Dale always thought it was a weird place for stairs and made it his weekly picnic spot before heading back home.\n\nIt was spring and the white dogwoods were now green as all the trees were waking up. Dale sat on the stairs admiring the bright green world around him and the warmish air. Finishing his sandwich he stood to leave but did a double take as he looked at the top. The stairs seemed longer.\n\nA shiver went over him as a breeze picked up.\n\nHe took a step up and as he did the stairwell seemed to extend further. Again he stepped up the hill and again it grew longer.\n\nDale turned around, taking a step down and the same thing happened. A mild panic welled within and he shuffled down the stairs. On and on he went but neither reached the end nor came any closer to the bottom of the hill. They were endless!\n\n\"What is this!\" Dale called out loud with no answer.\n\nJust then, as he looked down the stairs his eyes seemed to peer further and far away to the end. The stairwell itself seemed normal, easy, and wide enough. Towards the end, it started to crumble. At the bottom, he saw what looked like himself, Dale! Except that he was an old man. He looked worn out, almost defeated, as he sighed sorrowfully in his chair. He was in a room all alone except for a nurse. Dread washed over Dale and a tear fell down his face.\n\nQuickly turning away, Dale started to make his way up the stairs, but the same thing happened. This time, instead of easy and wide, this stairwell looked difficult, narrow, and even dangerous. He heard a dog barking far away. At the top, he was once again him as an old man, except he was smiling. Instead of fear and dread, he was joyful and also not alone. A woman was with him though facing the other way. Only her ponytail and orange scrunchie were visible.\n\nOrange scrunchie?! Immediately his mind reeled to where he had seen an orange scrunchie before. The jogger girl on his morning circuit! He had seen it a hundred times with her. \"Is that...?\"\n\nBut before Dale could think any further he heard a dog barking and getting closer. He tried to run down the stairs but it was too late, a giant wolf lept on him full force. Dale screamed and shut his eyes waiting to be eaten up. But there was nothing.\n\nHe opened his eyes and the wolf was gone. Dale once again found himself sitting on the normal steps across from the sandwich shop.\n\nSweat beaded down his face (the most he'd sweat in 2 years).\n\nComing to his senses, he started walking back home, trying to brush off whatever that was that happened. It must have been a dream or pollen in the air or food poisoning.\n\n\"Last time I'm eating a meatball sandwich!\" he muttered to himself, though knowing it was a lie right when he said it. They were too good!\n\n**Part 3: Kicking It Into Gear**\n\nThe vision stayed vivid throughout the week as a weird mix of fear, dread, and joy swirled within him. It probably meant nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd then there was the image, as clear as day. He didn't wish for it but it was there and it stayed there the rest of that week.\n\nThe jogger girl with the orange scrunchie.\n\nFor some odd reason, the strangest conviction came over him. He may have felt drops of it before, but this was a tidal wave.\n\n\"I need to meet her!\" he thought, and a new determination was born.\n\nOut the door he went, not even tying his shoe. Immediately Dale scanned the neighborhood to see if she was there.\n\nSure enough she was, 100 yards away already in stride.\n\nDale hopped on the street and picked up his pace faster than normal as he ran past each house towards Krogers. Baskerville was barking ahead which told Dale she must have just passed him. Turning a corner he saw her behind Krogers and picked it up even more. He started to get winded.\n\nPushing himself harder than he ever had, Dale soon passed the barking dog. He gave a quick wave to Jim and made his way toward Union Cemetery Hill. His legs started to ache and he felt his lungs burning but he was gaining ground!\n\nAnd then came the cramp. Halfway up the hill pain shot through his leg and he collapsed onto a tombstone for support. Gasping for breath, he looked up as he tried to straighten his leg. He saw the girl cross the top of the hill and well beyond his reach.\n\nDefeated. Feeling discouraged and foolish, Dale didn't even finish his circuit. He hobbled back home the way he came. Baskerville yelled at him a second time as if mocking his failure.\n\nDale arrived home with hurt pride. His resolve, though, was not. His mission to meet the jogger girl had become his top priority.\n\nAnd so the next day he tried again but didn't get very far because he was so sore. In fact the whole week he didn't gain much ground but pushed himself anyway. By the next week, Dale noticed himself getting a little closer. The orange scrunch girl was still keeping a strong pace at about 70 yards ahead.\n\nThe following week Dale got a little smarter. He decided to break his routine and start earlier to get ahead. That didn't work either, as she also seemed to start earlier and was even further away. Several times Dale tried this but never got an inch closer.\n\nOne day he went so early he found himself 100 yards ahead of her!\n\n\"Great, I'll just wait up for her to reach me then introduce myself!\" he thought.\n\nIt didn't work either. As Dale stood there waiting near Krogers, she may have seen him but turned down another road. He was left standing alone again near the cemetery.\n\nTiming wasn't going to be the answer. And so Dale decided he'd just have to catch up.\n\nDay after day he pushed himself through soreness, burning lungs, and well beyond his well-managed comfort zone. Every day he returned to his house sweaty, defeated, and sore, but somehow still felt like a win. He was getting faster and stronger as his run was now around 23min!\n\nThen catastrophe struck when the thought came, “What if she's getting faster also? What if she notices me getting closer and is speeding up herself to stay away? She probably thinks I'm a crazy person!”\n\nHe wrestled with this thought throughout the day but shrugged it off. \"A crazy person would not be leisurely jogging day in and day out. And I know I'm not crazy,\" he thought as a picture of him being roommates with old Henry popped into his mind. \"No way she thinks that. I only have one option- I have to finish this race!\"\n\nWeeks went by as Dale hammered out his new routine. He would bolt out the door and push himself to gain three, four, five yards on the mysterious jogger.\n\nTime flew by, one month, two months, and finally, his goal was within reach. Only about thirty yards behind and he was feeling as confident, strong, and in shape as ever!\n\n**Part 4: Game Time**\n\nIt was a hot summer morning as Dale hopped out of bed ready for the run. He had no way of knowing that today would be the last day he would run in a long long time.\n\nA faint glow of a sunrise lightened the fading night sky on the horizon. Stars were still shining overhead as Dale sped out the door and soon down the street.\n\nHis pace started strong and he felt like a lion. As Dale began to turn the corner of the neighborhood, he heard Baskerville start to bark.\n\n\"She must be passing him,\" he thought and picked up the pace.\n\nBut then Dale heard something different. As Baskerville barked, Dale heard a snapping sound, louder barking, and a short scream.\n\nDale paused, then rushed around the corner to see the scene. Baskerville broke his chain and was tailing the girl. She bolted away towards the Krogers parking lot trying to get away.\n\nKicking it into gear, Dale shot off in a sprint after the two as he raced across the street.\n\nHe was gaining on them as he ran faster than he had ever run before. His legs felt strong and he was not even out of breath,\n\nAnother scream! The girl fell in the parking lot not 40 yards ahead and was holding her ankle. The hound was barreling down and would be there in seconds.\n\nDale slammed it into a gear he didn't even know he had. He shot off like a bullet towards the dog, yelling to get its attention. \"Over here! Over here!\"\n\nAs Baskerville was about to pounce on the girl, it heard the yelling. Turning its head, he saw Dale spearing towards him.\n\nClosing in, Dale taunted it, \"This way you hellhound!\" and Dale sped past the dog, slapping it on the back to draw it away.\n\nImmediately Baskerville changed directions. He tore after Dale, who was now running for dear life towards the cemetery. Into the woods they went. Dale sprinted up the hill, in and around gravestones while the hound gained on his heels. He hurdled one headstone then another, trying to shake the beast as he climbed the slope.\n\nDale's legs were now burning along with his lungs. He couldn't do too much more of this. Meanwhile, Baskerville seemed only to gain steam.\n\nDale tried hopping over another stone but this time his foot caught and down he went. He slammed against the ground. A split second later Baskerville was latched onto his leg, shaking it like a toy.\n\nPain jolted through Dale's body and the thought, \"He's going to eat me!\" flashed in his mind and he closed his eyes.\n\nSuddenly, Dale heard a loud screech, pounding footsteps, and an electric buzzing sound.\n\nBaskerville released his grip and fell motionless to the ground. Standing above him was Jim the security guard holding a smoking taser. Dale gave a half smile, looked down at his bloody leg, then passed out.\n\nDale woke up in a hospital bed. Groggily he looked up and saw his leg bandaged up and down. There was no one around him but he heard people walking and talking back and forth on the other side of the curtain.\n\nHis leg was numb from pain meds. He couldn't think straight. \"What happened,\" he mumbled to himself.\n\nLooking around he muttered, \"I can remember. I can't think. I need...I need. Coffee! My third cup of coffee!\"\n\nNot seeing a nurse, Dale squinted through the crack in the curtain. Doctors and nurses rushed by. But then he saw it- a coffee machine across the room.\n\nPain meds still working, Dale decided to risk it and hobbled out of bed. Seeing that the coast was clear, he emerged from the curtain and limped towards the coffee maker. It was almost empty! Not only that, but someone else was beating Dale to it- a lady with a limp.\n\nDale picked up the pace but she was too fast. She was pouring the last drop into her cup right as he shuffled up.\n\nAt first he groaned, but then as he looked at the lady he gasped. The ponytail and the orange scrunchie! The lady heard the gasp and turned around.\n\nDale's jaw dropped, realizing his imagination did her no justice!\n\n\"I'm so sorry!\" she said. \"I think I just topped it off. Here, let me split it.\"\n\nShe reached for another mug and poured in half her coffee.\n\n\"My name's Jan. What brought you here?\"\n\nDale recovered from his shock, smiled, and took a sip.\n\nEpilogue: 1 Month Later\n\nDale woke up at 5 am sharp. Got his coffee, wolfed down his Cliff bar then limped out the door. His leg was getting better but still had some ways to go. Much much slower, Dale started walking down the street. The sunrise warmed up the summer air and everything felt new. He turned down a side street and reached a nearby condo complex and rang the doorbell.\n\nMinutes later, Jan opened the door and smiled at her \"running\" companion. Dale reached out his hand, which she took. A moment later, the two of them were off to the races as they slowly limped down the sidewalk together.","src/content/blog/running-for-dear-life.md","1ee86e860d1e1da8",{"html":106,"metadata":107},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/running-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a woman running up stone steps\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Part 1: Too Slow, Too Steady\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When Dale was 9, his parents took him to the biggest ice cream parlor this side of the Ohio River.

Every day he returned to his house sweaty, defeated, and sore, but somehow still felt like a win. He was getting faster and stronger as his run was now around 23min!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then catastrophe struck when the thought came, “What if she’s getting faster also? What if she notices me getting closer and is speeding up herself to stay away? She probably thinks I’m a crazy person!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He wrestled with this thought throughout the day but shrugged it off. “A crazy person would not be leisurely jogging day in and day out. And I know I’m not crazy,” he thought as a picture of him being roommates with old Henry popped into his mind. “No way she thinks that. I only have one option- I have to finish this race!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Weeks went by as Dale hammered out his new routine. He would bolt out the door and push himself to gain three, four, five yards on the mysterious jogger.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Time flew by, one month, two months, and finally, his goal was within reach. Only about thirty yards behind and he was feeling as confident, strong, and in shape as ever!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Part 4: Game Time\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was a hot summer morning as Dale hopped out of bed ready for the run. He had no way of knowing that today would be the last day he would run in a long long time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A faint glow of a sunrise lightened the fading night sky on the horizon. Stars were still shining overhead as Dale sped out the door and soon down the street.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His pace started strong and he felt like a lion. As Dale began to turn the corner of the neighborhood, he heard Baskerville start to bark.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“She must be passing him,” he thought and picked up the pace.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But then Dale heard something different. As Baskerville barked, Dale heard a snapping sound, louder barking, and a short scream.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale paused, then rushed around the corner to see the scene. Baskerville broke his chain and was tailing the girl. She bolted away towards the Krogers parking lot trying to get away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kicking it into gear, Dale shot off in a sprint after the two as he raced across the street.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He was gaining on them as he ran faster than he had ever run before. His legs felt strong and he was not even out of breath,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another scream! The girl fell in the parking lot not 40 yards ahead and was holding her ankle. The hound was barreling down and would be there in seconds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale slammed it into a gear he didn’t even know he had. He shot off like a bullet towards the dog, yelling to get its attention. “Over here! Over here!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As Baskerville was about to pounce on the girl, it heard the yelling. Turning its head, he saw Dale spearing towards him.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Closing in, Dale taunted it, “This way you hellhound!” and Dale sped past the dog, slapping it on the back to draw it away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Immediately Baskerville changed directions. He tore after Dale, who was now running for dear life towards the cemetery. Into the woods they went. Dale sprinted up the hill, in and around gravestones while the hound gained on his heels. He hurdled one headstone then another, trying to shake the beast as he climbed the slope.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale’s legs were now burning along with his lungs. He couldn’t do too much more of this. Meanwhile, Baskerville seemed only to gain steam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale tried hopping over another stone but this time his foot caught and down he went. He slammed against the ground. A split second later Baskerville was latched onto his leg, shaking it like a toy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pain jolted through Dale’s body and the thought, “He’s going to eat me!” flashed in his mind and he closed his eyes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Suddenly, Dale heard a loud screech, pounding footsteps, and an electric buzzing sound.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Baskerville released his grip and fell motionless to the ground. Standing above him was Jim the security guard holding a smoking taser. Dale gave a half smile, looked down at his bloody leg, then passed out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale woke up in a hospital bed. Groggily he looked up and saw his leg bandaged up and down. There was no one around him but he heard people walking and talking back and forth on the other side of the curtain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His leg was numb from pain meds. He couldn’t think straight. “What happened,” he mumbled to himself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Looking around he muttered, “I can remember. I can’t think. I need…I need. Coffee! My third cup of coffee!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not seeing a nurse, Dale squinted through the crack in the curtain. Doctors and nurses rushed by. But then he saw it- a coffee machine across the room.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pain meds still working, Dale decided to risk it and hobbled out of bed. Seeing that the coast was clear, he emerged from the curtain and limped towards the coffee maker. It was almost empty! Not only that, but someone else was beating Dale to it- a lady with a limp.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale picked up the pace but she was too fast. She was pouring the last drop into her cup right as he shuffled up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At first he groaned, but then as he looked at the lady he gasped. The ponytail and the orange scrunchie! The lady heard the gasp and turned around.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale’s jaw dropped, realizing his imagination did her no justice!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I’m so sorry!” she said. “I think I just topped it off. Here, let me split it.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She reached for another mug and poured in half her coffee.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“My name’s Jan. What brought you here?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale recovered from his shock, smiled, and took a sip.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Epilogue: 1 Month Later\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dale woke up at 5 am sharp. Got his coffee, wolfed down his Cliff bar then limped out the door. His leg was getting better but still had some ways to go. Much much slower, Dale started walking down the street. The sunrise warmed up the summer air and everything felt new. He turned down a side street and reached a nearby condo complex and rang the doorbell.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Minutes later, Jan opened the door and smiled at her “running” companion. Dale reached out his hand, which she took. A moment later, the two of them were off to the races as they slowly limped down the sidewalk together.\u003C/p>",{"headings":108,"localImagePaths":109,"remoteImagePaths":110,"frontmatter":111,"imagePaths":112},[],[],[],{"title":98,"publishDate":100,"description":99,"author":42},[],"story-that-painted-itself",{"id":113,"data":115,"body":120,"filePath":121,"digest":122,"rendered":123},{"title":116,"description":117,"publishDate":118,"author":119},"The Story that Painted Itself","What's painted on the surface might lead to what's buried beneath.","4 April 2025",{"id":11,"collection":9},"![Illustration of man waving from a mural](/assets/blog/mural.png)\n\n\nIt started with the hands. Kara always sketched out her murals before she painted them. And this one, she needed to get just right. The hands would welcome new visitors to the area. Everything else in her sketch was perfect. So perfect that she had already begun painting them, but Kara never thought the hands were good enough. Something about them wasn’t quite right. She’d spent hours in her studio above The Downtown Bakery on Fourth Street, sketching and sketching, erasing, and crossing out, starting over. The hands needed to look just right. They needed to look like they could build things or play catch or lift a child into the air. But they just looked stiff. \n\nMaybe that was why she noticed him.\n\nThe mural had begun like all the others that Kara had updated, or painted as originals around Steubenville, “the town of murals” as it advertised itself sometime in decades past. She had loved maintaining the old murals, like the one of the old steel mill where her grandpa once worked, or of the steamboats that floated down the Ohio River, or a forgotten Market Street that bustled with activity. \n\nThis time around, she was painting an original street scene from the 1950s. A welcoming man was in the foreground, turning as if to greet someone. Kara hadn’t planned on putting him there; that’s not where he was in her sketch, but there were times when Kara felt her brush move before her mind caught up like the wall itself whispered what it wanted to be. In moments when inspiration hit her so strongly, she couldn’t say no. As she painted, it was like the figure was guiding her. He knew where he wanted to be, the posture of his shoulders, the smile on his face, and the position of his hands. The hands that Kara had been practicing, sketching over and over, the ones she could never get right. But after all that sketching, here they were, painted on the wall, absolutely perfect. \n\nThe position of the fingers was just right, the hand, reaching out welcoming the viewer into his world, matching his kind face.\n\nThere was something familiar about it too. Kara couldn’t recall ever meeting someone who looked like this, but he had a twinkle in his eye with a tilted fedora drawing you to look more deeply at his face. \n\n“There you are,” Kara said to the painting. That would be enough for tonight. The sun was getting dim, the sky filled with pinks and oranges, and it was like the whole world was celebrating the mural with her. Kara snapped a picture of the mural, packed up her paints, rolled the windows down in her car, and took in the warm, early summer air.\n\nThe next morning, she excitedly made her way back to finish the mural. But everything changed when she stood in front of her masterpiece. He had moved. She was sure of it.  She grabbed her phone out of her pocket, pulling up yesterday’s photo. The difference was subtle but unmistakable. His smile was a bit wider, and instead of a welcoming hand, it was a waving hand. \n\n“What is happening?” she wondered aloud. She continued working on the background, the bustling streets, the open markets. She was still happy with her work, but she wasn’t able to work at the same pace as she was the day before. She felt like an anxiety was stirring her to be somewhere else. She worked until dusk, with what felt like days more work ahead of her as she packed up her supplies for the weekend, happy to have a break before the mural was complete.\n\nKara was a habitual creature, and part of her routine was going to the library every Saturday morning. She was particularly excited to go this Saturday because she had included a painting of the old library in her mural and couldn’t wait to show Mrs. Rogers, the elderly town librarian who had shared stories and photos from “the good old days when people walked to the library.”\nShe found Mrs. Rogers in the genealogy section, as usual.\n“I finally finished the library section,” Kara said, pulling up a photo of the mural on her phone. “What do you think?”\n“Oh my!” Mrs. Rogers exclaimed when she saw the image. “That looks just like Stanley Blackburn! He was our town’s most famous librarian back then. Legend has it that he hid a special time capsule somewhere in the old library before they tore it down. It was never found.”\n\n“Stanley?” Kara whispered.\n\n“Yes, he always wore his fedora tilted like that. Everyone loved him. He believed in the power of stories to keep us immortal.”\nAfter promising to return the following week with a print of the mural, Kara left with a driving sense of purpose. Despite her resolve to take the weekend off, she hurried back to the mural. To her astonishment, Stanley had moved again. Now he was angled differently, toward the old library in the back of the mural. \n“Are you trying to tell me something, Stanley?” Kara asked. \n\nShe could’ve sworn that Stanley’s eyes twinkled in response. And when she looked more closely, it was as if his hand was pointing to a specific brick in the old library wall. \n\n“Well, I guess we’re about to take a detour.” Kara snapped a picture of the mural and made her way to where the old library once stood. The brick Stanley was pointing to appeared to be on the side of the library’s foundation, just under a window. Kara wasn’t one for conspiracies and magic, but she knew she was being summoned. \n\nThe real building was long gone, replaced by the drab office complexes popular in the 1980s, but maybe it was there somewhere.\n\nBy noon, she stood at the edge of the parking lot, tracing the shape of the old library in her mind. A few neighborhood kids stopped to see what this strange woman was doing in the parking lot.\n\n“Watcha looking for?” the brave one called over.\n\n“A brick,” Kara said without caring how ridiculous that sounded while she was staring at a five-story brick building. It must’ve been a boring Saturday because the kids pedaled over to her to help her find the brick.\n\nWith the help of some neighborhood kids, and some enthusiastic digging, they uncovered a loose brick exactly where Stanley had been pointing. It shifted as Kara reached for it. She gently pulled it out and discovered a metal box behind it.\n\nShe wasn’t going to wait to open it. Sitting cross-legged in the parking lot, she tore it open, surrounded by the curious kids and the afternoon sun. Inside, were dozens of children’s stories signed by Stanley Blackburn accompanied by photos of old Steubenville, letters, newspaper clippings, and a worn leather journal. \n\nKara carefully opened it. On the first page, written in neat cursive, was the story, “A Friendly Mural.” Her eyes widened.\n\nIt was a story about a town librarian who loved stories so much that he found a way to continue being a part of them, even after he was gone.\n\nAt the end, Stanley had written, “Maybe someday, someone will paint me into one of our town’s murals, and I can help them to find this very book that you’re reading.”\n\n“I guess I found you,” Kara whispered.\nWhen Kara went back to the mural, Stanley was no longer pointing. He was exactly as she had initially painted him, warm smile, fedora tilted, hand reaching out in welcome.\nShe traced her finger along the mural’s edge. Stanley had passed her more than just a story. He taught her how to paint hands that could welcome, how to paint stories not from what she saw but from what needed to be remembered, stories that were lost in forgotten corners waiting to be uncovered, to come alive.","src/content/blog/story-that-painted-itself.md","a95c5e2e1a161398",{"html":124,"metadata":125},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/mural.png\" alt=\"Illustration of man waving from a mural\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It started with the hands.

No one said anything until they reached the shore.\n\nAll three teenagers stood in a line. They looked out over the Ohio River at Browns Island, the infamous piece of land between Ohio and West Virginia. It stretched for over two hundred acres in the middle of the river. Old steel structures, remnants of abandoned industry, occupied the bottom part of the island. The land above it transitioned into thick pockets of trees stretching to the top of the island.\n\nA steel swing set sat above a ledge on the adjacent shore. The lone swing blew back and forth and back and forth—presumably from the wind. \n\nTommy’s friend Dustin broke the silence. “Just look at it, man,” he pointed to the swing set. “No way that island’s not haunted. It reminds me of Chernobyl.” \n\n“What are you talking about?” replied Tommy. “It’s mostly grass, trees, and scrap.”\n\n“You’re honestly telling me you don’t believe any of the stories?” asked Kaleb.  \n\n“You’re going to have to be more specific. The one about the ghost ship? The one about the guy who fell into the well never to be seen again? Or is it the shark-sized catfish that patrols the island, making sure you’re stuck there for eternity?” \n\nKaleb fumbled over which words to choose and finally landed on, “Yes. All of the above.” He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a book titled *Legends of the Ohio Valley*. It was earmarked to death and smooth at the edges. He opened it. \n\n “It says right here, and I quote, '*The Stanley* steamboat left Browns Island on the evening of July 4th. Shortly after, a few miles downstream, it tragically collided with another excursion boat—*the Starlight Express*—that instantly sank, resulting in one of the greatest tragedies of its time.'”\n\nKaleb closed the book and turned his attention to Tommy. “Yeah, man. Good luck with that. No way this river’s not haunted. It’s all right here.” He tapped the book with his other hand. “Read it tonight. I dare you.” Kaleb tossed the book into the crate at the back of Tommy’s kayak. \n\n“You seriously expect me to be scared of steamboat Stanley?” Tommy burst into laughter. “C’mon, man. You also heard Old Lady Loftiss’s house is haunted. And the salt mines at Gould’s. And the mill. Give it up. You can’t believe everything you hear in a small town.”\n\n“I wouldn’t be so sure of yourself, son.” A raspy voice caught their attention. \n\nThey just realized someone else was there—a lone fisherman. He sat in a pop-up chair with two fishing poles, each upright between a stick with a taut fishing line leading into the water. The fisherman continued, “I’ve lived here long enough to know one thing—this valley’s not like any other. I can vouch for that.” The fisherman leaned back in his chair and put his hat over his eyes as if he were going back to sleep. “But good luck to you, son. Tell the island I said hello.”\n\nThe fisherman nodded to the boys, and even though he couldn’t see them, Kaleb and Dustin nodded back in respect—Tommy just rolled his eyes. \n\n“Sounds like a wino if you ask me,” Tommy mumbled to his friends as he dragged his kayak to the edge of the river. When his sandaled foot touched the water, ripples shot out, spreading through the river towards the island. The water was warm, yet chills ran down his spine. \n\n“Well, it looks like this is goodbye,” said Dustin. \n\n“Did you—,” Tommy started to ask his friends if they had noticed the strange ripples, but stopped. It was probably just a fish. “Yep. Looks like this is it. Here.” He hands Dustin his phone. “Keep this until tomorrow.”\n\nDustin hesitated but took the phone. “Really? What if you need help? Or your mom needs you?”\n\n“If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it right and off the grid. And besides. She hasn’t talked to me since the accident. If she calls, tell her I’m sorry. And I want my car keys back.” \n\nTommy stowed his backpack underneath the deck. Then, he double-checked the plastic supply crate. Check. It was securely fastened to the back of the kayak. \n\n“I can’t wait to tell everyone on senior trip how loony both of you are. Just make sure you have my hundred dollars waiting for me tomorrow morning, okay?” Tommy smiled at both of them, then hopped into his kayak. “Farewell, my friends. Please pray that I make it out alive.” \n\nUsing the oar to push off the shore, Tommy launched himself into the river. His friends watched quietly as he began rowing to the island, a football field away.\n\nTommy looked for more rippling water but saw nothing. This section of the river was now like a glassy lake. He looked for other kayakers, boats, fishermen, but saw no one. Part of Tommy thought this was strange. Maybe people did avoid this island. But the other part of Tommy diverted to a different outlook—he would have the entire stretch of river to himself. And this was exactly what he needed. \n\nWhat Tommy didn’t tell them was that he could use a night alone in the wilderness. A night away from the world. From the chaos. A piece of him hoped the island was haunted—he could use a good scare to forget about what happened. To distract himself from the video replaying in his head, over and over and over again, daring his little brother to jump off the utility bridge into the river. Tommy’s done it a hundred times before. How was he supposed to know there was something in the water? He never meant for his brother to get hurt. In time, Tommy had faith his little brother would be okay and prayed he would be able to walk again—but for now, the present moment was a nightmare. \n\nThis leisurely drift continued until he was halfway to the island. Then, everything shifted. As he rowed closer, the current changed. The top of the water remained still, as did the wind. But now it felt like Tommy’s kayak was being pulled to the island. For a moment, Tommy thought he felt something swim under the kayak, scraping the plastic beneath him from his torso to the tips of his shoes. He looked at the green water behind him but saw nothing. He looked back at his friends on the distant shoreline, quickly growing smaller and smaller. As he turned to look back at the island, he was nearly thrown out of the kayak. \n\nSkrrrch!\n\n“Ahh,” Tommy cried out, startled to find that he had landed on the rocky shore of Browns Island. He sat idly on his kayak, questioning the water behind him. It was so still that it could have passed as a frozen pond. Then, his line of questioning ended as abruptly as his landing. Any feeling of uneasiness was blown away by the sweet air around him, inviting him to turn around to finally meet the island. \n\nIt was much bigger than he thought it would be. It also had a distinct aroma. No longer could Tommy smell the sourness from the river. Here, the air was sugary and welcoming, like a lush field of wheat. Yet, there was no wheat to be found anywhere.\n\nA childlike laugh stole his attention. He turned in the direction of the noise. It came from the swingset he saw when he was on the other shore. It was rusted with one swing still attached—but it wasn’t swinging anymore. It was now wrapped around the top bar. Tommy held out his hand. Absolutely no wind. Odd, to say the least. \n\nTommy hopped out at the front of the kayak and dragged it onto dry land. Let the exploring begin. \n\nFor the next few hours, he explored the island with three objectives: first, to find a good camping spot; second, to find the arrowheads that everyone talks about; and third, to find a ghost. It’s worth mentioning that Tommy never aimed for something that he knew he couldn’t get. He always had a strange knack for ending up in unexplainable places.\n\nThe island, so far, was less eventful than he had hoped. More walking than anything. The old plant at the southern part of the island had already been scrapped and scavenged. All that remained of it was a concrete slab, leftover pieces of equipment, and patches of woods. The smell reminded Tommy of when his family would drive over the Veterans Memorial Bridge when he was a kid. A few miles downstream was an operating coke plant that reeked of sulfur. Here, that same strong smell hung in the air. Although no sign of the plant remained on Browns Island, it still smelled like it was running. Tommy could have sworn it even sounded like it was in full operation. He looked around him. Trying to find where the sound of steel clanking, chains rattling, and hissing steam was coming from, but it was a barren wasteland. He resolved that Kaleb had gotten into his head and that it was time to move on to better things, like the office building left behind from the old plant. \n\nHis excitement faded the moment he stepped inside the office. Nothing important remained: pay stubs, invoices, cabinets—just the usual boring office stuff, all tossed aside by earlier visitors. The only mildly interesting part was a pack of survival gear: water, blankets, matches, and other essentials. Someone must have been hiding out here. Whoever it was, though, kept a clean camp, leaving nothing of value behind. Tommy had seen enough. But as he started to leave, he heard something buzzing. He turned to see a desk lamp flickering on the other side of the room.\n\n*Weird*, Tommy thought. *So there’s still electricity here.* \n\nBut when he approached the lamp, he saw that it was unplugged. When he took a closer look at the bulb, it stopped. He watched it, waiting for it to turn on again, hoping it did so he wouldn’t have to doubt that it was on in the first place. But it flickered no more. \n\nTommy again cursed Kaleb for putting a bug in his ear and moved on to explore the northern part of the island. \n\nOver the next few hours of his trek, he noticed that a seam split the island in half like vertebrae. In some places, the land sank into deep crevices. In other places, rock jutted out as high as his knees. The top layer was sandstone. However, in the highest spots, a strange rock peeked out from underneath. Tommy hit a small chunk of the weird rock with the back of his knife. He could have sworn the rock recoiled after he struck it, but reasoned that his eyes had to be playing tricks on him. As he examined the rock fragment, he couldn’t tell what color it was. Depending on the way the sunlight hit it, the rock was sometimes blue and other times gold. It was a cool souvenir, to say the least. He thought little more of it and shoved the rock into his pocket and pushed on until he was near the top of the island.\n\nThis area was freckled with trees, wildflowers, and overgrowth. Kaleb’s book mentioned that there used to be a home and a small lighthouse at the top of the island. It said that people would have weddings and large parties here during the warmer months. So when Tommy stumbled upon a few rows of struggling apple trees, he knew he must be near where the old house used to be. The trees had only a few shriveled apples, but the whole area smelled rotten. It was as if an entire harvest had spoiled. He looked at the ground but saw no apples. Strange. Maybe there was a dead animal carcass nearby, but when he looked around him, he had a realization: he had not seen one sign of life here. There were no traces of animals anywhere on the ground or above. When a flock of birds flew near the island, they split. One group flew on the left side of the river as the others flew around the right side—no bird flew directly over the island. He even spotted a bald eagle on the West Virginia riverbank—but not one bird could be seen on this island. \n\n    Strange.\n\n*Maybe the island’s contaminated from the mills, Tommy thought. Which means I’ll probably become a mutant after spending a night here.*\n\nDeep down inside, he always wished that mutants could exist. What kid wouldn't want to become like an X-Men? Bending physics and time to fight the forces of evil. Maybe this was his one chance. As fun as the idea seemed, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Kaleb might be right about the eerie island. Tommy had yet to see anything haunting, but this island just felt off. Still, he again suppressed this feeling and settled on the thought that this would be the easiest money he’s ever made. He also settled on the top of the island being the best place to camp. He could see the wide river splitting around the sides of the island. Plus, there was a cozy patch of grass surrounded by trees, providing an open canopy for the stars and cover from passing boats…if there were any. \n\nObjective one complete—cool place to camp.\n\nNext, he set up his simple camp: a small one-person tent and a cooler of hot dogs and pop. And when he was carrying stones from the shore for his fire pit, he crossed off his second objective. Wedged inside a ball full of tree roots at the river’s edge, he spotted a pointed stone.\n\nObjective two complete—he found an arrowhead. \n\t\nNow, if only he could find that ghost. Maybe the arrowhead would summon a special guest. Tommy could only wish. \n\nBefore long, a fire was blazing. The stars began to awaken as the sun dipped farther below the valley hills. When he camped, the forest would always come alive. Weird noises, screeches, caws, and growls would materialize from the darkness—but not here. It felt like a void. Most moments were absent of any sound. But every so often, something would jolt him. Once, he thought he heard something fly over his head, almost like an arrow. Another time, he ducked when it felt and sounded like an aircraft flew overhead. When he looked up, there was nothing there but the stars. Soon after, a strange aroma filled the air. It tasted like pennies. The air felt ionized, charged like it smells right before a lightning storm. Yet, it was a cloudless night. He sat still. Looking, smelling, and listening for more oddities. \n\nAnd the longer he sat there, the more in tune he became with the area. When he faced upstream, he felt like he could differentiate the left side of the river from the right. The left side made him feel nostalgic, as if looking at an old family photograph. The right side energized him like Christmas Eve. Each side didn't just sound different; they felt different. It was like soft, barely inaudible frequencies were hitting his innermost eardrum. Still, he wasn’t convinced. His mind, more likely than not, was playing tricks on him. So, instead of stewing in paranoia, Tommy did the best thing he could think of—he ate his branching fears away. \n\nAfter a feast of three hot dogs and two Cosmic Brownie s’mores, he looked at his watch—10 PM. Still, no ghosts. Considering the land he was on, all of the Native Americans that lived here, the time George Washington visited the island, the settlers who built their homes here, the bootleggers that hid here, the tragedies that took place here, how could there possibly be no ghosts? \n\nTommy didn’t mind, though. Sure, a ghost would be a cool story, but he came here for solitude. He needed this, a chance to think about life before his brother’s accident, a moment to live without being stuck neck deep in guilt, the opportunity to think about life after high school. Was Toledo the right school for him? Who knows. Was the girl he’s dating destined to be the one? Maybe? Only time would tell. \n\nAs these thoughts muddled together, something else was brewing. It wasn’t sudden, though. It was gradual, like when you’re lying in bed at night. Everything is quiet. Then, the faintest sound appears, and you wonder if it’s all in your head. So you lie there, questioning this sound for some time before you finally stand up to investigate. \n\nThis was what it felt like for Tommy. By now, he was confident he could differentiate the left river from the right river that split around the island. So when a faint hum emerged from the top of the island, he knew that something was up there. \n\nHe grabbed his flashlight and took off to investigate. \n\nThe ominous hum felt more like a frequency cutting into his gut than his eardrums. It pulled him through the most vegetated part of the island. As he walked farther, the feeling grew stronger, harmonizing with the sounds from the other sides of the river until they reached a point where they all converged into one note, one sound, one frequency. It was in the middle of a thicket. And Tommy nearly fell to his death as he came upon it. \n\n“Ahh!”\n\nTommy banged his shin against a stone. His momentum carried him forward, nearly stumbling face-first. But what waited in front of him wasn’t the ground. It was a dark hole sinking deep into the earth. \n\nHis shin gushed blood, but he didn’t notice. He was too transfixed. The frequencies were now a beautiful symphony that energized and terrified Tommy. He rushed to clear the brush in front of him, quickly realizing what he had run into—a well. \n\n“Oh my goodness. You actually exist,” he said out loud. \n\nOld stones were piled in a neat circle around a dark hole. He shined his light below. The beam couldn’t reach the bottom. \n\n“Hello, down there,” he yelled. “Anyone hiding below? Any ghosts down there?” To his reprieve—and slight disappointment—no one responded. \n\nHis light revealed many initials carved along the top of the well. Most of them were too faint to read. Some looked more like symbols. Only two carvings were legible. On the top read, Forsaken. And on the bottom, Locke. \n\n*I wonder if this was the man who got trapped in the well, Tommy thought.* \n\nHe leaned over the well and reached his flashlight as far down as he could. Still, the light did not touch the bottom—but it did reveal something else. They were nearly invisible and were covered in the same moss as the rest of the well. He grabbed one near the top of the well. It was a stone peg, possibly a railroad spike, wedged in between two stones. He followed them with his light and saw that there was a row of them leading down into the abyss. \n\nHis stomach dropped before he even had the thought: it was possible to climb down to the bottom of the well. \n\n*I should probably wait until daylight*, he thought. *Or at least wait until I’m with my friends.*\n\nThis thought made his stomach drop again. Tommy knew he only had one option. He was here now because his friends were wimps. He had to venture to the bottom of this forsaken well. \n\nHe spent no time second-guessing himself and plunged into the depths. \n\nOne peg after another, he inched himself lower into the well. Testing each peg with the weight of his foot before lowering himself to the next one. \n\n*This is either the dumbest or coolest thing I’ve ever done. Please, God. Make it be the latter.* \n\nBefore long, he was deep enough that he couldn’t see the top. A type of vertigo set in. Stuck in a tunnel of darkness where he couldn’t see where up or down was anymore. Still, brushing his panic aside, he made it this far. No turning back now.\n\nAround fifteen pegs later, as the frequency hummed louder than ever, his light finally hit the bottom. \n\nHis speed increased, and soon enough, he was once again standing. And it was a colossal letdown. All that was down here were wet rocks, some beer cans, and a strange creature. It looked like a salamander or a snake, maybe a mutated version of both. When he shined his light on it, the creature vanished between the rocks. \n\nTommy let out a long sigh. He had done it. He did something his friends wouldn’t dare to do. And he knew that if they were done here now, they also wouldn't do this—\n\n\tCLICK!\n\nHe turned his flashlight off. Darkness engulfed him. It might have been thirty seconds or five minutes. His body felt so disoriented that he couldn't tell. As he went to turn on his flashlight again, he stopped.\n\nA faint blue glow snuck through the cracks of the bottom of the well. The light was so pale that Tommy wasn’t sure if it was real. He reached down and touched the crack, then immediately yanked his hand back. It felt like an electric pulse shot through his fingertip and spread throughout his body. The shock came suddenly and left just as fast, making it easy to doubt anything really happened. He took a closer look but couldn’t find the glow he thought he saw. \n\nWeird, he thought to himself. Maybe that creature glows in the dark. \n\nHe stood still in the dark for a few more uneventful minutes. Nothing was happening. No ghosts were appearing. The frequency he thought he heard all along grew quiet. And his adrenaline was tanking. It was time to return.\n\nPeg by peg, he began his ascent. After the tenth peg, he stopped. The frequency returned louder than ever. Though this wasn’t why he stopped. He stopped because the bottom of the well started to rumble. Then, the walls of the well started to shake. He gripped the pegs with his life, hugging close to the wall, climbing up as fast as he could.\n\nBut then, the rumbling stopped—and so did Tommy. His heart nearly stopped, too, when he looked back down to the bottom of the well—or, better put, where it used to be. \n\nHe didn’t need a flashlight to see what was below him. The bottom had opened up deeper under the island, lit brightly in blue and gold light by a newly formed tunnel.\n\n“Hello? Is anyone down there?”\n\nThe only response was the mysterious frequency. This time, it was undeniable. He could feel the weight of it pulling him downward. Tommy took one look at the top of the dark well, shook his head, then began his descent back down to the bottom. \n\nThe tunnel didn’t look man-made, but rather like a tectonic place separated for the sake of passage. It was easy to move through. Around the size of a doorway with a gentle slope.\n\nThe walls were made of the same translucent rock Tommy had found on the surface. But here, they glowed brilliantly, resembling bulging veins. The right wall’s veins were neon blue and pulsated, never staying in one place but moving as if they were alive. The left wall behaved the same, but with shimmering gold veins. Each wall reminded Tommy of his anatomy class where they studied the brain. The lights looked like synapses firing across various branches. \n\nTommy’s attention turned to his pocket. It, too, was glowing. He reached into his jeans and took out the rock he had found above. It glowed with both colors in cadence with the movements on the walls. It felt both warm and cold in the palm of his hand. \n\nOn the surface, he questioned whether he could hear the different sides of the river. Down here, he was certain. The golden side comforted him. The blue side energized him. And the middle frequency tugged at him, drawing him into the magical tunnel beneath the island. \n\nHe stowed the rock back into his pocket and stepped into the abyss. It felt like he was on another planet in the middle of space. Nothing felt like earth. If a black hole was anti-matter, a scar in the universe, devouring light and energy, then this was the opposite. Tim never felt more alive. His brain felt ignited. Blazing with energy as he stepped deeper into the tunnel. Memories flashed before him. They were so vivid he couldn’t tell if he was actually seeing them or imagining them. Memories from his childhood. From his brother’s accident. But then visions he didn’t remember. Visions of him as a grown man. Visions of strangers. Some, in the distant past. Others, in a strange, unknown land. Voices echoed from each side of the wall. He couldn’t make out their words, but he somehow knew exactly what they were asking for—help!\n\nSuddenly, the visions and voices stopped. Tommy had reached the end of the tunnel. The walls continued into a large, cave-like room.\n\nIf the tunnel was the spinal cord, then this was the brain. The walls were still split. Half blue and half gold. They curved out and then in to form a translucent, globe-like room. The room burst with neon colors, branching out rapidly in constant motion. The frequencies he heard were now one. The only thing he could compare it to was the call whales made. Somewhat haunting. Somewhat muffled. Changing in pitch. Bouncing between the walls in perfect harmony. \n\n*Something* along the right wall struck his curiosity. He questioned his eyes for a bit, but he knew he wasn’t imagining it. He was looking at a vintage Volkswagen stuck beyond the glass-like wall. \n\n*What in the world?*\n\nNone of this made sense. He stepped within inches of the wall, squinting as he leaned in, hoping something—anything—would explain this, when—\n\n“Ahh!”\n\nTommy jumped back, falling to the ground of rock and sand. His heart raced. His eyes widened. His brain spiraled. His focus fixated on the thick whiskers. Then the enormous eyeballs. And finally, the dorsal fin. It was a giant catfish, bigger than the Volkswagen below it. \n\n*What a minute. That would mean…*\n\n“I’m under the river!”","src/content/blog/escape-from-browns-island-chapter-1.md","852175a9cad36572",{"html":143,"metadata":144},"\u003Ch2 id=\"chapter-1-the-island-beckons\">Chapter 1: The Island Beckons\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.” — Heraclitus\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>“You really don’t have to do this.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“A bet’s a bet,” Tommy replied as he dragged his kayak out of the back of a small truck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“We were joking, man,” said Tommy’s other friend, Kaleb. “We didn’t think you’d actually do it.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy stopped and took turns glaring at both of his friends. “You guys are welcome to join me, you know.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They exchanged quick, scared glances and then looked off into nowhere.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy shook his shaven head—“That’s what I thought”—and started pulling his kayak down the riverbank. No one said anything until they reached the shore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All three teenagers stood in a line. They looked out over the Ohio River at Browns Island, the infamous piece of land between Ohio and West Virginia. It stretched for over two hundred acres in the middle of the river. Old steel structures, remnants of abandoned industry, occupied the bottom part of the island. The land above it transitioned into thick pockets of trees stretching to the top of the island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A steel swing set sat above a ledge on the adjacent shore. The lone swing blew back and forth and back and forth—presumably from the wind.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy’s friend Dustin broke the silence. “Just look at it, man,” he pointed to the swing set. “No way that island’s not haunted. It reminds me of Chernobyl.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“What are you talking about?” replied Tommy. “It’s mostly grass, trees, and scrap.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You’re honestly telling me you don’t believe any of the stories?” asked Kaleb.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You’re going to have to be more specific.

Or is it the shark-sized catfish that patrols the island, making sure you’re stuck there for eternity?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kaleb fumbled over which words to choose and finally landed on, “Yes. All of the above.” He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a book titled \u003Cem>Legends of the Ohio Valley\u003C/em>. It was earmarked to death and smooth at the edges. He opened it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“It says right here, and I quote, ‘\u003Cem>The Stanley\u003C/em> steamboat left Browns Island on the evening of July 4th. Shortly after, a few miles downstream, it tragically collided with another excursion boat—\u003Cem>the Starlight Express\u003C/em>—that instantly sank, resulting in one of the greatest tragedies of its time.’”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kaleb closed the book and turned his attention to Tommy. “Yeah, man. Good luck with that. No way this river’s not haunted. It’s all right here.” He tapped the book with his other hand. “Read it tonight. I dare you.” Kaleb tossed the book into the crate at the back of Tommy’s kayak.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You seriously expect me to be scared of steamboat Stanley?” Tommy burst into laughter. “C’mon, man. You also heard Old Lady Loftiss’s house is haunted. And the salt mines at Gould’s. And the mill. Give it up. You can’t believe everything you hear in a small town.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I wouldn’t be so sure of yourself, son.” A raspy voice caught their attention.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They just realized someone else was there—a lone fisherman. He sat in a pop-up chair with two fishing poles, each upright between a stick with a taut fishing line leading into the water. The fisherman continued, “I’ve lived here long enough to know one thing—this valley’s not like any other. I can vouch for that.” The fisherman leaned back in his chair and put his hat over his eyes as if he were going back to sleep. “But good luck to you, son. Tell the island I said hello.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The fisherman nodded to the boys, and even though he couldn’t see them, Kaleb and Dustin nodded back in respect—Tommy just rolled his eyes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Sounds like a wino if you ask me,” Tommy mumbled to his friends as he dragged his kayak to the edge of the river. When his sandaled foot touched the water, ripples shot out, spreading through the river towards the island. The water was warm, yet chills ran down his spine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Well, it looks like this is goodbye,” said Dustin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Did you—,” Tommy started to ask his friends if they had noticed the strange ripples, but stopped. It was probably just a fish. “Yep. Looks like this is it. Here.” He hands Dustin his phone. “Keep this until tomorrow.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dustin hesitated but took the phone. “Really? What if you need help? Or your mom needs you?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it right and off the grid. And besides. She hasn’t talked to me since the accident. If she calls, tell her I’m sorry. And I want my car keys back.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy stowed his backpack underneath the deck. Then, he double-checked the plastic supply crate. Check. It was securely fastened to the back of the kayak.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I can’t wait to tell everyone on senior trip how loony both of you are. Just make sure you have my hundred dollars waiting for me tomorrow morning, okay?” Tommy smiled at both of them, then hopped into his kayak. “Farewell, my friends. Please pray that I make it out alive.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Using the oar to push off the shore, Tommy launched himself into the river. His friends watched quietly as he began rowing to the island, a football field away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy looked for more rippling water but saw nothing. This section of the river was now like a glassy lake. He looked for other kayakers, boats, fishermen, but saw no one. Part of Tommy thought this was strange. Maybe people did avoid this island. But the other part of Tommy diverted to a different outlook—he would have the entire stretch of river to himself. And this was exactly what he needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What Tommy didn’t tell them was that he could use a night alone in the wilderness. A night away from the world. From the chaos. A piece of him hoped the island was haunted—he could use a good scare to forget about what happened. To distract himself from the video replaying in his head, over and over and over again, daring his little brother to jump off the utility bridge into the river. Tommy’s done it a hundred times before. How was he supposed to know there was something in the water? He never meant for his brother to get hurt. In time, Tommy had faith his little brother would be okay and prayed he would be able to walk again—but for now, the present moment was a nightmare.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This leisurely drift continued until he was halfway to the island. Then, everything shifted. As he rowed closer, the current changed. The top of the water remained still, as did the wind. But now it felt like Tommy’s kayak was being pulled to the island. For a moment, Tommy thought he felt something swim under the kayak, scraping the plastic beneath him from his torso to the tips of his shoes. He looked at the green water behind him but saw nothing. He looked back at his friends on the distant shoreline, quickly growing smaller and smaller. As he turned to look back at the island, he was nearly thrown out of the kayak.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Skrrrch!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Ahh,” Tommy cried out, startled to find that he had landed on the rocky shore of Browns Island. He sat idly on his kayak, questioning the water behind him. It was so still that it could have passed as a frozen pond. Then, his line of questioning ended as abruptly as his landing. Any feeling of uneasiness was blown away by the sweet air around him, inviting him to turn around to finally meet the island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was much bigger than he thought it would be. It also had a distinct aroma. No longer could Tommy smell the sourness from the river. Here, the air was sugary and welcoming, like a lush field of wheat. Yet, there was no wheat to be found anywhere.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A childlike laugh stole his attention. He turned in the direction of the noise. It came from the swingset he saw when he was on the other shore. It was rusted with one swing still attached—but it wasn’t swinging anymore. It was now wrapped around the top bar. Tommy held out his hand. Absolutely no wind. Odd, to say the least.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy hopped out at the front of the kayak and dragged it onto dry land. Let the exploring begin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the next few hours, he explored the island with three objectives: first, to find a good camping spot; second, to find the arrowheads that everyone talks about; and third, to find a ghost.

The old plant at the southern part of the island had already been scrapped and scavenged. All that remained of it was a concrete slab, leftover pieces of equipment, and patches of woods. The smell reminded Tommy of when his family would drive over the Veterans Memorial Bridge when he was a kid. A few miles downstream was an operating coke plant that reeked of sulfur. Here, that same strong smell hung in the air. Although no sign of the plant remained on Browns Island, it still smelled like it was running. Tommy could have sworn it even sounded like it was in full operation. He looked around him. Trying to find where the sound of steel clanking, chains rattling, and hissing steam was coming from, but it was a barren wasteland. He resolved that Kaleb had gotten into his head and that it was time to move on to better things, like the office building left behind from the old plant.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His excitement faded the moment he stepped inside the office.

Whoever it was, though, kept a clean camp, leaving nothing of value behind. Tommy had seen enough. But as he started to leave, he heard something buzzing. He turned to see a desk lamp flickering on the other side of the room.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Weird\u003C/em>, Tommy thought. \u003Cem>So there’s still electricity here.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But when he approached the lamp, he saw that it was unplugged. When he took a closer look at the bulb, it stopped. He watched it, waiting for it to turn on again, hoping it did so he wouldn’t have to doubt that it was on in the first place. But it flickered no more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy again cursed Kaleb for putting a bug in his ear and moved on to explore the northern part of the island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the next few hours of his trek, he noticed that a seam split the island in half like vertebrae. In some places, the land sank into deep crevices. In other places, rock jutted out as high as his knees. The top layer was sandstone. However, in the highest spots, a strange rock peeked out from underneath. Tommy hit a small chunk of the weird rock with the back of his knife. He could have sworn the rock recoiled after he struck it, but reasoned that his eyes had to be playing tricks on him. As he examined the rock fragment, he couldn’t tell what color it was. Depending on the way the sunlight hit it, the rock was sometimes blue and other times gold. It was a cool souvenir, to say the least. He thought little more of it and shoved the rock into his pocket and pushed on until he was near the top of the island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This area was freckled with trees, wildflowers, and overgrowth. Kaleb’s book mentioned that there used to be a home and a small lighthouse at the top of the island. It said that people would have weddings and large parties here during the warmer months. So when Tommy stumbled upon a few rows of struggling apple trees, he knew he must be near where the old house used to be. The trees had only a few shriveled apples, but the whole area smelled rotten. It was as if an entire harvest had spoiled. He looked at the ground but saw no apples. Strange. Maybe there was a dead animal carcass nearby, but when he looked around him, he had a realization: he had not seen one sign of life here. There were no traces of animals anywhere on the ground or above. When a flock of birds flew near the island, they split. One group flew on the left side of the river as the others flew around the right side—no bird flew directly over the island. He even spotted a bald eagle on the West Virginia riverbank—but not one bird could be seen on this island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code nord\" style=\"background-color:#2e3440ff;color:#d8dee9ff; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>Strange.\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Maybe the island’s contaminated from the mills, Tommy thought. Which means I’ll probably become a mutant after spending a night here.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Deep down inside, he always wished that mutants could exist. What kid wouldn’t want to become like an X-Men? Bending physics and time to fight the forces of evil. Maybe this was his one chance. As fun as the idea seemed, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Kaleb might be right about the eerie island. Tommy had yet to see anything haunting, but this island just felt off. Still, he again suppressed this feeling and settled on the thought that this would be the easiest money he’s ever made. He also settled on the top of the island being the best place to camp. He could see the wide river splitting around the sides of the island. Plus, there was a cozy patch of grass surrounded by trees, providing an open canopy for the stars and cover from passing boats…if there were any.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Objective one complete—cool place to camp.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next, he set up his simple camp: a small one-person tent and a cooler of hot dogs and pop. And when he was carrying stones from the shore for his fire pit, he crossed off his second objective. Wedged inside a ball full of tree roots at the river’s edge, he spotted a pointed stone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Objective two complete—he found an arrowhead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now, if only he could find that ghost. Maybe the arrowhead would summon a special guest. Tommy could only wish.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before long, a fire was blazing. The stars began to awaken as the sun dipped farther below the valley hills. When he camped, the forest would always come alive. Weird noises, screeches, caws, and growls would materialize from the darkness—but not here. It felt like a void. Most moments were absent of any sound. But every so often, something would jolt him. Once, he thought he heard something fly over his head, almost like an arrow. Another time, he ducked when it felt and sounded like an aircraft flew overhead. When he looked up, there was nothing there but the stars. Soon after, a strange aroma filled the air. It tasted like pennies. The air felt ionized, charged like it smells right before a lightning storm. Yet, it was a cloudless night. He sat still. Looking, smelling, and listening for more oddities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the longer he sat there, the more in tune he became with the area. When he faced upstream, he felt like he could differentiate the left side of the river from the right. The left side made him feel nostalgic, as if looking at an old family photograph. The right side energized him like Christmas Eve. Each side didn’t just sound different; they felt different. It was like soft, barely inaudible frequencies were hitting his innermost eardrum. Still, he wasn’t convinced. His mind, more likely than not, was playing tricks on him. So, instead of stewing in paranoia, Tommy did the best thing he could think of—he ate his branching fears away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a feast of three hot dogs and two Cosmic Brownie s’mores, he looked at his watch—10 PM. Still, no ghosts. Considering the land he was on, all of the Native Americans that lived here, the time George Washington visited the island, the settlers who built their homes here, the bootleggers that hid here, the tragedies that took place here, how could there possibly be no ghosts?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy didn’t mind, though. Sure, a ghost would be a cool story, but he came here for solitude. He needed this, a chance to think about life before his brother’s accident, a moment to live without being stuck neck deep in guilt, the opportunity to think about life after high school. Was Toledo the right school for him? Who knows. Was the girl he’s dating destined to be the one? Maybe? Only time would tell.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As these thoughts muddled together, something else was brewing. It wasn’t sudden, though. It was gradual, like when you’re lying in bed at night. Everything is quiet. Then, the faintest sound appears, and you wonder if it’s all in your head. So you lie there, questioning this sound for some time before you finally stand up to investigate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This was what it felt like for Tommy. By now, he was confident he could differentiate the left river from the right river that split around the island. So when a faint hum emerged from the top of the island, he knew that something was up there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He grabbed his flashlight and took off to investigate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ominous hum felt more like a frequency cutting into his gut than his eardrums. It pulled him through the most vegetated part of the island. As he walked farther, the feeling grew stronger, harmonizing with the sounds from the other sides of the river until they reached a point where they all converged into one note, one sound, one frequency. It was in the middle of a thicket. And Tommy nearly fell to his death as he came upon it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Ahh!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy banged his shin against a stone. His momentum carried him forward, nearly stumbling face-first. But what waited in front of him wasn’t the ground. It was a dark hole sinking deep into the earth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His shin gushed blood, but he didn’t notice. He was too transfixed. The frequencies were now a beautiful symphony that energized and terrified Tommy. He rushed to clear the brush in front of him, quickly realizing what he had run into—a well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Oh my goodness. You actually exist,” he said out loud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Old stones were piled in a neat circle around a dark hole. He shined his light below. The beam couldn’t reach the bottom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Hello, down there,” he yelled. “Anyone hiding below? Any ghosts down there?” To his reprieve—and slight disappointment—no one responded.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His light revealed many initials carved along the top of the well. Most of them were too faint to read. Some looked more like symbols. Only two carvings were legible. On the top read, Forsaken. And on the bottom, Locke.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>I wonder if this was the man who got trapped in the well, Tommy thought.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He leaned over the well and reached his flashlight as far down as he could. Still, the light did not touch the bottom—but it did reveal something else. They were nearly invisible and were covered in the same moss as the rest of the well. He grabbed one near the top of the well. It was a stone peg, possibly a railroad spike, wedged in between two stones. He followed them with his light and saw that there was a row of them leading down into the abyss.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His stomach dropped before he even had the thought: it was possible to climb down to the bottom of the well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>I should probably wait until daylight\u003C/em>, he thought. \u003Cem>Or at least wait until I’m with my friends.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This thought made his stomach drop again. Tommy knew he only had one option. He was here now because his friends were wimps. He had to venture to the bottom of this forsaken well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He spent no time second-guessing himself and plunged into the depths.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One peg after another, he inched himself lower into the well. Testing each peg with the weight of his foot before lowering himself to the next one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This is either the dumbest or coolest thing I’ve ever done. Please, God. Make it be the latter.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before long, he was deep enough that he couldn’t see the top. A type of vertigo set in. Stuck in a tunnel of darkness where he couldn’t see where up or down was anymore. Still, brushing his panic aside, he made it this far. No turning back now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Around fifteen pegs later, as the frequency hummed louder than ever, his light finally hit the bottom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His speed increased, and soon enough, he was once again standing. And it was a colossal letdown. All that was down here were wet rocks, some beer cans, and a strange creature. It looked like a salamander or a snake, maybe a mutated version of both. When he shined his light on it, the creature vanished between the rocks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy let out a long sigh. He had done it. He did something his friends wouldn’t dare to do. And he knew that if they were done here now, they also wouldn’t do this—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code nord\" style=\"background-color:#2e3440ff;color:#d8dee9ff; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>CLICK!\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>He turned his flashlight off. Darkness engulfed him. It might have been thirty seconds or five minutes. His body felt so disoriented that he couldn’t tell. As he went to turn on his flashlight again, he stopped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A faint blue glow snuck through the cracks of the bottom of the well. The light was so pale that Tommy wasn’t sure if it was real. He reached down and touched the crack, then immediately yanked his hand back. It felt like an electric pulse shot through his fingertip and spread throughout his body. The shock came suddenly and left just as fast, making it easy to doubt anything really happened. He took a closer look but couldn’t find the glow he thought he saw.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Weird, he thought to himself. Maybe that creature glows in the dark.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He stood still in the dark for a few more uneventful minutes. Nothing was happening. No ghosts were appearing. The frequency he thought he heard all along grew quiet. And his adrenaline was tanking. It was time to return.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peg by peg, he began his ascent. After the tenth peg, he stopped. The frequency returned louder than ever. Though this wasn’t why he stopped. He stopped because the bottom of the well started to rumble. Then, the walls of the well started to shake. He gripped the pegs with his life, hugging close to the wall, climbing up as fast as he could.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But then, the rumbling stopped—and so did Tommy. His heart nearly stopped, too, when he looked back down to the bottom of the well—or, better put, where it used to be.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He didn’t need a flashlight to see what was below him. The bottom had opened up deeper under the island, lit brightly in blue and gold light by a newly formed tunnel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Hello? Is anyone down there?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The only response was the mysterious frequency. This time, it was undeniable. He could feel the weight of it pulling him downward. Tommy took one look at the top of the dark well, shook his head, then began his descent back down to the bottom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tunnel didn’t look man-made, but rather like a tectonic place separated for the sake of passage. It was easy to move through. Around the size of a doorway with a gentle slope.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The walls were made of the same translucent rock Tommy had found on the surface. But here, they glowed brilliantly, resembling bulging veins. The right wall’s veins were neon blue and pulsated, never staying in one place but moving as if they were alive. The left wall behaved the same, but with shimmering gold veins. Each wall reminded Tommy of his anatomy class where they studied the brain. The lights looked like synapses firing across various branches.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy’s attention turned to his pocket. It, too, was glowing. He reached into his jeans and took out the rock he had found above. It glowed with both colors in cadence with the movements on the walls. It felt both warm and cold in the palm of his hand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the surface, he questioned whether he could hear the different sides of the river. Down here, he was certain. The golden side comforted him. The blue side energized him. And the middle frequency tugged at him, drawing him into the magical tunnel beneath the island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He stowed the rock back into his pocket and stepped into the abyss. It felt like he was on another planet in the middle of space. Nothing felt like earth. If a black hole was anti-matter, a scar in the universe, devouring light and energy, then this was the opposite. Tim never felt more alive. His brain felt ignited. Blazing with energy as he stepped deeper into the tunnel. Memories flashed before him. They were so vivid he couldn’t tell if he was actually seeing them or imagining them. Memories from his childhood. From his brother’s accident. But then visions he didn’t remember. Visions of him as a grown man. Visions of strangers. Some, in the distant past. Others, in a strange, unknown land. Voices echoed from each side of the wall. He couldn’t make out their words, but he somehow knew exactly what they were asking for—help!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Suddenly, the visions and voices stopped. Tommy had reached the end of the tunnel. The walls continued into a large, cave-like room.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If the tunnel was the spinal cord, then this was the brain. The walls were still split. Half blue and half gold. They curved out and then in to form a translucent, globe-like room. The room burst with neon colors, branching out rapidly in constant motion. The frequencies he heard were now one. The only thing he could compare it to was the call whales made. Somewhat haunting. Somewhat muffled. Changing in pitch. Bouncing between the walls in perfect harmony.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Something\u003C/em> along the right wall struck his curiosity. He questioned his eyes for a bit, but he knew he wasn’t imagining it. He was looking at a vintage Volkswagen stuck beyond the glass-like wall.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>What in the world?\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>None of this made sense. He stepped within inches of the wall, squinting as he leaned in, hoping something—anything—would explain this, when—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Ahh!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tommy jumped back, falling to the ground of rock and sand. His heart raced. His eyes widened. His brain spiraled. His focus fixated on the thick whiskers. Then the enormous eyeballs. And finally, the dorsal fin. It was a giant catfish, bigger than the Volkswagen below it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>What a minute. That would mean…\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I’m under the river!”\u003C/p>",{"headings":145,"localImagePaths":150,"remoteImagePaths":151,"frontmatter":152,"imagePaths":153},[146],{"depth":147,"slug":148,"text":149},2,"chapter-1-the-island-beckons","Chapter 1: The Island Beckons",[],[],{"title":134,"publishDate":136,"description":135,"author":27,"hidden":138},[]]
