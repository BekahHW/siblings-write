All it took was a few inches of snow, and the hill would be flooded with kids, just like you’d see in the movies. Rows of sledders waited at the top of the hill for someone to yell out, “GO!” so they could race to the frozen creek at the bottom.\n\nIt was pure small-town livin’. Kids having fun. Parents happy cuz their kids were happy. Sounds good, right?

Their families vacationed in Myrtle Beach every summer, and they both shared the same illegal bat in their church softball league.\n\nStanley had a need, and his friend had the solution.\n\nFurther digging suggested that Stanley paid off his friend to shut down Jeff Tech’s hill, forcing all of the kids to fill the void left from sledding. Where exactly would they fill this void? You guessed it—at Stanley’s mall.\n\nAs the kids would say, the mall was now “bumpin'.” Parents were forced to allocate part of their Powerball investment so that their kids had money to spend at Stanley’s mall.

Who orchestrated this master plan starting with Jeff Tech, predicting the human course of behavior all the way to parents’ having no choice but to grow closer to their kids?\n\nNo one other than a psyop brought to you by your local community center promoting their new campaign, “The Year of the Family.” Their manager —David Opal Sr.—socially engineered every level of it, all so he could be promoted to president. He first planted the seed to Stanley, predicting what would likely happen next. He single-handedly ruined sled riding in the valley all for the sake of a job title.

It's across a field at the base of a hill, Pleasant Heights. This is a large neighborhood that stretches back to the hospital and then dips back down into Beatty Park below. There's not much to notice about this little landmark. It appears as a collapsed entrance to an old mine. Locals report it used to be a watering station for horses heading that direction a long time ago. And they are correct. But that is only part of it. There are rumors that there is more to it. That it is an abandoned bunker or science lab from the previous century. That it is a burial ground for Native Americans or that a mythical beast sleeps beneath. Or, a Civil War general hid his gold there when escaping west from the war. Whatever the case, it's always intrigued me as a kid, and I've fated myself with one day exploring what it actually is. And today is that day! A special thanks goes out to the Ohio Valley Historical Society as well as the Pittsburgh Archeological Foundation, who both sponsored this event. In moments, we will see what lies beneath the hill of Pleasant Heights, and hopefully, it is as pleasant as its name!\"\n\nSome light chuckles emitted from the nearly dozen people who stood on the grass observing the event.\n\n\"I, Martin Smythe, and my cameraman, Denson, will be recording each step along the way. You'll all be able to see it on this screen or posted live online for those not with us.\"\n\nThe explorer waved at the camera to those watching from the internet.\n\n\"Now let the show begin!\"\n\nThe camera kept on the explorer, and they approached the collapsed entrance to the tunnel. As rocks and dirt were dug out, the camera shook as the two men climbed around and into the darkness on the other side. The beams of their flashlights led the way.\n\n\"The air is musty and damp. There appears to be a path leading down into the cave. No litter or garbage. Seems like no one has been here in a long time.\"\n\nFurther down into the dark cave, the two men went. Their flashlights wandered up and down the walls, looking for anything interesting or out of place.\n\n\"And as we examine these rocks, we can....oh wait...what's this?\"\n\nMartin directed the camera to the ground towards what looked like a concrete floor. Following it around, they saw it connected to walls and a low ceiling as well. It was as if the cave led into an underground building.\n\n\"It looks like there might be something to the bunker theory!\" Martin exclaimed to the camera.\n\nFurther in they went as Martin described the now man-made walls of the tunnel sloping down. They came across various rooms along the hallway. Some were empty, while others were filled with old office furniture. Several had what looked like primitive machines from the 50s or 60s that somehow still had power. Blips and beeps disrupted the otherwise silent building.\n\n\"We could easily spend a whole week looking at all of this! This is amazing! It appears the tunnel keeps going, though, and we will press on!\"\n\nFurther down, the concrete walls soon turned to rock again. The air was colder and even more damp.\n\n\"By my calculations, we may be approaching deep beneath downtown Steubenville. The river would be beyond,\" said Martin to the camera.\n\nAs he said this, he noticed his voice echoed across the walls as if entering a larger open space. A faint glow appeared around the bend. Picking up the pace, they cleared the corner and were speechless at what they saw.\n\nThe camera fluttered this way and that, taking in the scene in front of them. They were in a giant cavern. The ceiling rose 100 yards. Beneath it looked like an abandoned little city, with buildings lining the streets. Some structures looked more modern, while others had older architecture. A few entire buildings stood out and were of a design Martin had never seen before. The cave seemed to stretch back a quarter mile. Oddly enough, the back wall appeared luminescent, like glowing rock.\n\nMartin stepped forward into the room and felt like he was walking through a thin, invisible waterfall. Immediately, the back wall pulsed, and a wave of wind and light traveled across the room. The two men fell to the ground, and the camera slid away.\n\nWhat happened next is not fully describable. As the camera continued rolling, flashes of images appeared with each wave of light from the wall.\n\nPulse. Darkness and fear. Giant shapes moved in the cave. Pulse. Two people brought a light that grew across the back wall, and the dark shapes left. Pulse. People appeared, and soon buildings, streets, and a thriving city. Pulse. The people were gone, and the buildings deteriorated. Different people showed up, and the light dimmed. Pulse. These new people also left, the light dimmed further, and the dark shapes appeared on the other side of the wall. Pulse. The light faded as the dark creatures broke into the cavern. Fear returned.\n\nThese images then cycled back to the beginning and started over, this time picking up speed and intensity.\n\nThe explorers looked on with tears in their eyes. The magnificence, mystery, and terror at what they saw was overwhelming.\n\nWithout warning, the wind and light picked back up even more. The camera fell to the ground and slid backward as the wind drove it further into the tunnel.\n\nThe last shot the camera saw was the two explorers holding onto a rock. Martin yelled something inaudible to Denson as the roaring wind nearly took them off their feet.\n\nThere was another flash of light, and then the camera went black.\n\nThat was the last of the recording.\n\nThere was a moment of uneasiness in the room as the screen went blank. Finally, a voice spoke up.\n\n\"What was the date on the recording?\" said a man with a deep voice.\n\n\"May 10, 2025,\" a second person responded, sounding slightly flustered. \"That is almost twenty-two years from now.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"And who found this?\"\n\n\"A couple kids at Beatty Park found a little cave. They discovered the camera and brought it to their parents. Eventually, it found its way to us.\"\n\n\"And the explorer, do we have an identification on him?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we found a match. A local living on La Belle. Except....\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"He's only seven.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"Hmm, why didn't we stop him?\" the man pondered to himself. \"Something must have happened. Obviously we were...unless...\" The unfinished thought hung heavy in the air. He regained his posture and continued, \"Very well then. Business as usual. Keep an eye on the boy and keep people away from the cave. Also, we'll have to pick things up. Give me more regular reports on the mill. I have a feeling that's going to escalate before we know it. Apparently, we may only have twenty-two years. Let's pray it gives us enough time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. We will keep you posted.\"\n\nThe man turned to leave the room.\n\n\"Oh, one more thing, Denson....we'll have to work on your camera skills.

These new people also left, the light dimmed further, and the dark shapes appeared on the other side of the wall. Pulse. The light faded as the dark creatures broke into the cavern. Fear returned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These images then cycled back to the beginning and started over, this time picking up speed and intensity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The explorers looked on with tears in their eyes. The magnificence, mystery, and terror at what they saw was overwhelming.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Without warning, the wind and light picked back up even more. The camera fell to the ground and slid backward as the wind drove it further into the tunnel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The last shot the camera saw was the two explorers holding onto a rock.

Finally, a voice spoke up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“What was the date on the recording?” said a man with a deep voice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“May 10, 2025,” a second person responded, sounding slightly flustered. “That is almost twenty-two years from now.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More silence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“And who found this?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“A couple kids at Beatty Park found a little cave. They discovered the camera and brought it to their parents. Eventually, it found its way to us.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“And the explorer, do we have an identification on him?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Yes, sir, we found a match. A local living on La Belle. Except…”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“What is it?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“He’s only seven.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More silence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Hmm, why didn’t we stop him?” the man pondered to himself. “Something must have happened. Obviously we were…unless…” The unfinished thought hung heavy in the air. He regained his posture and continued, “Very well then. Business as usual. Keep an eye on the boy and keep people away from the cave. Also, we’ll have to pick things up. Give me more regular reports on the mill. I have a feeling that’s going to escalate before we know it. Apparently, we may only have twenty-two years. Let’s pray it gives us enough time.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Yes, sir. We will keep you posted.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The man turned to leave the room.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Oh, one more thing, Denson…we’ll have to work on your camera skills.

Kara always sketched out her murals before she painted them. And this one, she needed to get just right. The hands would welcome new visitors to the area. Everything else in her sketch was perfect. So perfect that she had already begun painting them, but Kara never thought the hands were good enough. Something about them wasn’t quite right. She’d spent hours in her studio above The Downtown Bakery on Fourth Street, sketching and sketching, erasing, and crossing out, starting over. The hands needed to look just right. They needed to look like they could build things or play catch or lift a child into the air. But they just looked stiff. \n\nMaybe that was why she noticed him.\n\nThe mural had begun like all the others that Kara had updated, or painted as originals around Steubenville, “the town of murals” as it advertised itself sometime in decades past. She had loved maintaining the old murals, like the one of the old steel mill where her grandpa once worked, or of the steamboats that floated down the Ohio River, or a forgotten Market Street that bustled with activity. \n\nThis time around, she was painting an original street scene from the 1950s. A welcoming man was in the foreground, turning as if to greet someone. Kara hadn’t planned on putting him there; that’s not where he was in her sketch, but there were times when Kara felt her brush move before her mind caught up like the wall itself whispered what it wanted to be. In moments when inspiration hit her so strongly, she couldn’t say no. As she painted, it was like the figure was guiding her. He knew where he wanted to be, the posture of his shoulders, the smile on his face, and the position of his hands. The hands that Kara had been practicing, sketching over and over, the ones she could never get right. But after all that sketching, here they were, painted on the wall, absolutely perfect. \n\nThe position of the fingers was just right, the hand, reaching out welcoming the viewer into his world, matching his kind face.\n\nThere was something familiar about it too. Kara couldn’t recall ever meeting someone who looked like this, but he had a twinkle in his eye with a tilted fedora drawing you to look more deeply at his face. \n\n“There you are,” Kara said to the painting. That would be enough for tonight. The sun was getting dim, the sky filled with pinks and oranges, and it was like the whole world was celebrating the mural with her. Kara snapped a picture of the mural, packed up her paints, rolled the windows down in her car, and took in the warm, early summer air.\n\nThe next morning, she excitedly made her way back to finish the mural. But everything changed when she stood in front of her masterpiece. He had moved. She was sure of it.  She grabbed her phone out of her pocket, pulling up yesterday’s photo. The difference was subtle but unmistakable. His smile was a bit wider, and instead of a welcoming hand, it was a waving hand. \n\n“What is happening?” she wondered aloud. She continued working on the background, the bustling streets, the open markets. She was still happy with her work, but she wasn’t able to work at the same pace as she was the day before. She felt like an anxiety was stirring her to be somewhere else. She worked until dusk, with what felt like days more work ahead of her as she packed up her supplies for the weekend, happy to have a break before the mural was complete.\n\nKara was a habitual creature, and part of her routine was going to the library every Saturday morning. She was particularly excited to go this Saturday because she had included a painting of the old library in her mural and couldn’t wait to show Mrs. Rogers, the elderly town librarian who had shared stories and photos from “the good old days when people walked to the library.”\nShe found Mrs. Rogers in the genealogy section, as usual.\n“I finally finished the library section,” Kara said, pulling up a photo of the mural on her phone. “What do you think?”\n“Oh my!” Mrs. Rogers exclaimed when she saw the image. “That looks just like Stanley Blackburn! He was our town’s most famous librarian back then. Legend has it that he hid a special time capsule somewhere in the old library before they tore it down. It was never found.”\n\n“Stanley?” Kara whispered.\n\n“Yes, he always wore his fedora tilted like that. Everyone loved him. He believed in the power of stories to keep us immortal.”\nAfter promising to return the following week with a print of the mural, Kara left with a driving sense of purpose. Despite her resolve to take the weekend off, she hurried back to the mural. To her astonishment, Stanley had moved again. Now he was angled differently, toward the old library in the back of the mural. \n“Are you trying to tell me something, Stanley?” Kara asked. \n\nShe could’ve sworn that Stanley’s eyes twinkled in response. And when she looked more closely, it was as if his hand was pointing to a specific brick in the old library wall. \n\n“Well, I guess we’re about to take a detour.” Kara snapped a picture of the mural and made her way to where the old library once stood. The brick Stanley was pointing to appeared to be on the side of the library’s foundation, just under a window. Kara wasn’t one for conspiracies and magic, but she knew she was being summoned. \n\nThe real building was long gone, replaced by the drab office complexes popular in the 1980s, but maybe it was there somewhere.\n\nBy noon, she stood at the edge of the parking lot, tracing the shape of the old library in her mind. A few neighborhood kids stopped to see what this strange woman was doing in the parking lot.\n\n“Watcha looking for?” the brave one called over.\n\n“A brick,” Kara said without caring how ridiculous that sounded while she was staring at a five-story brick building. It must’ve been a boring Saturday because the kids pedaled over to her to help her find the brick.\n\nWith the help of some neighborhood kids, and some enthusiastic digging, they uncovered a loose brick exactly where Stanley had been pointing. It shifted as Kara reached for it. She gently pulled it out and discovered a metal box behind it.\n\nShe wasn’t going to wait to open it. Sitting cross-legged in the parking lot, she tore it open, surrounded by the curious kids and the afternoon sun. Inside, were dozens of children’s stories signed by Stanley Blackburn accompanied by photos of old Steubenville, letters, newspaper clippings, and a worn leather journal. \n\nKara carefully opened it. On the first page, written in neat cursive, was the story, “A Friendly Mural.” Her eyes widened.\n\nIt was a story about a town librarian who loved stories so much that he found a way to continue being a part of them, even after he was gone.\n\nAt the end, Stanley had written, “Maybe someday, someone will paint me into one of our town’s murals, and I can help them to find this very book that you’re reading.”\n\n“I guess I found you,” Kara whispered.\nWhen Kara went back to the mural, Stanley was no longer pointing. He was exactly as she had initially painted him, warm smile, fedora tilted, hand reaching out in welcome.\nShe traced her finger along the mural’s edge. Stanley had passed her more than just a story. He taught her how to paint hands that could welcome, how to paint stories not from what she saw but from what needed to be remembered, stories that were lost in forgotten corners waiting to be uncovered, to come alive.","src/content/blog/story-that-painted-itself.md","d3474bb3d7aca8f0",{"html":105,"metadata":106},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/mural.png\" alt=\"Illustration of man waving from a mural\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It started with the hands.
